TI  - Zn-incorporation with graphene oxide on Ti substrates surface to improve
      osteogenic activity and inhibit bacterial adhesion.
LID - 10.1002/jbm.a.36740 [doi]
AB  - The poor osseointegration and postoperative bacterial infection are prominently
      responsible for the failure of titanium (Ti)-based implant in clinic. To address 
      above issues, methacryloyl modified graphene oxide (GOMA) as zinc ions (Zn(2+) ) 
      reservoir and release platform was fabricated on the Ti substrates with cathode
      electrophoresis deposition (EPD). Afterwards, phenylboronic acid (PBA)
      functionalization methacryloyl-gelatin (GelMA-PBA) was reacting with GOMA through
      in-situ free-radical polymerization to prepare GO-Zn/GelMA-PBA coating. The
      obtained coating was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray
      photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Zn ions release property, respectively. In
      vitro cellular experiments including cell activity, alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
      collagen secretion, extracellular matrix (ECM) mineralization, osteogenic genes
      and proteins, revealed that GO-Zn/GelMA-PBA coating was beneficial for enhancing 
      the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. The positive
      results were related to the existence of gelatin, formation of boronic ester
      between PBA groups and carbohydrates of osteoblasts surface. Meanwhile,
      antibacterial assay against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) confirmed that GO-Zn/GelMA-PBA coating on Ti
      substrates had superior antibacterial capacity, availably inhibited the bacterial
      adhesion and prevented formation of biofilm. Hence, the study provides a
      promising strategy for designing pro-osteogenesis and antibacterial coating on Ti
      substrates for orthopedic applications. This article is protected by copyright.

TI  - Impact of Different Titanium Implant Thread Designs on Bone Healing: A
      Biomechanical and Histometric Study with an Animal Model.
LID - E777 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm8060777 [doi]
AB  - Threads of dental implants with healing chamber configurations have become a
      target to improve osseointegration. This biomechanical and histometric study
      aimed to evaluate the influence of implant healing chamber configurations on the 
      torque removal value (RTv), percentage of bone-to-implant contact (BIC%), bone
      fraction occupancy inside the thread area (BAFO%), and bone and osteocyte density
      (Ost) in the rabbit tibia after two months of healing. Titanium implants with
      three different thread configurations were evaluated: Group 1 (G1), with a
      conventional "v" thread-shaped implant design; Group 2 (G2), with square threads;
      and Group 3 (G3), the experimental group with longer threads (healing chamber).
      Ten rabbits (4.5 +/- 0.5 kg) received three implants in each tibia (one per
      group), distributed in a randomized manner. After a period of two months, the
      tibia blocks (implants and the surrounding tissue) were removed and processed for
      ground sectioning to evaluate BIC%, BAFO%, and osteocyte density. The ANOVA
      one-way statistical test was used followed by the Bonferoni's multiple comparison
      test to determine individual difference among groups, considering a statistical
      difference when p < 0.05. Histometric evaluation showed a higher BAFO% values and
      Ost density for G3 in comparison with the other two groups (G1 and G2), with p < 
      0.05. However, the RTv and BIC% parameters were not significantly different
      between groups (p > 0.05). The histological data suggest that the healing
      chambers in the implant macrogeometry can improve the bone reaction in comparison
      with the conventional thread design.

TI  - Systemic and local effects of radiotherapy: an experimental study on implants
      placed in rats.
LID - 10.1007/s00784-019-02946-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the modulating effect of ionizing radiation, blood cytokine 
      levels, and bone remodeling of the interface around the implant to understand the
      radiation mechanisms which can impair the implants receptor site. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Sixty rats were submitted to grade V titanium implants in the femurs and
      were divided into the following groups: no-irradiation (N-Ir): control group with
      implant only; early-irradiation (E-Ir): implant + irradiation after 24 h;
      late-irradiation (L-Ir): implant + irradiation after 4 weeks; and
      previous-irradiation (P-Ir): irradiation + implant after 4 weeks. The animals in 
      the E-Ir, L-Ir, and P-Ir groups were irradiated in two fractional stages of 15
      Gy. At 3 days, 2 weeks, and 7 weeks after the final procedure, five animals were 
      randomly euthanized per group. Serum levels of TNF-a, IL-1beta, TGF-beta, IL-6,
      M-CSF, and IL-10 were measured from blood collected prior to euthanasia using the
      ELISA test. The pieces containing the implants were subjected to
      immunohistochemical labeling using the tartrate acid resistant to phosphatase,
      osteocalcin, and caspase-3 markers and mCT. The ANOVA test was used for
      statistical analysis, and the Tukey multiple comparison test (p < 0.05) was
      applied. RESULTS: The results indicated that ionizing radiation modifies the
      production of pro- and anti-inflammatory serum cytokines, the expression of
      proteins involved in bone remodeling and cellular apoptosis, as well as changes
      in bone formation. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggests that a longer period between
      radiotherapy and implant placement surgery when irradiation occurs prior to
      implant installation would allow the recovery and renewal of bone cells and avoid
      future failures in osseointegration. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The search for
      modifications caused by ionizing irradiation in bone tissue can indicate the
      ideal period for implant placement without affecting the osseointegration
      process.

LID - 10.1016/j.jcms.2019.05.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this in vitro study was to identify changes in gene
      expression of proinflammatory cytokines in human whole blood after contact with
      titanium implant surfaces after plasma treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Grade 4 
      titanium dental implants were conditioned with low-pressure plasma (LPP) and
      atmospheric-pressure plasma (APP) and submerged in human whole blood in vitro.
      Unconditioned implants and blood samples without implants served as control and
      negative control groups, respectively. Sampling was performed at 1, 8, and 24 h. 
      Changes in mRNA expression levels of interleukin 1-beta (IL1-beta) and tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were assessed using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: In the
      control group, significant increases in IL1-beta and TNF-alpha expression were
      observed. Significant decreases in the expression of IL1-beta and TNF-alpha were 
      identified in blood with implants after plasma treatment. CONCLUSION: Differences
      in gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines after incubation of
      plasma-conditioned titanium implants can be assessed using human whole blood. The
      results of the present study indicate that plasma treatment (APP and LPP) of
      titanium dental implants leads to downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine gene
      expression, which might be beneficial in early osseointegration.

TI  - Sandblasted and Acid Etched Titanium Dental Implant Surfaces Systematic Review
      and Confocal Microscopy Evaluation.
LID - E1763 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma12111763 [doi]
AB  - The field of dental implantology has made progress in recent years, allowing
      safer and predictable oral rehabilitations. Surely the rehabilitation times have 
      also been reduced, thanks to the advent of the new implant surfaces, which favour
      the osseointegration phases and allow the clinician to rehabilitate their
      patients earlier. To carry out this study, a search was conducted in the Pubmed, 
      Embase and Elsevier databases; the articles initially obtained according to the
      keywords used numbered 283, and then subsequently reduced to 10 once the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The review that has been carried
      out on this type of surface allows us to fully understand the features and above 
      all to evaluate all the advantages or not related. The study materials also are
      supported by a manufacturing company, which provided all the indications
      regarding surface treatment and confocal microscopy scans. In conclusion, we can 
      say that, thanks to these new surfaces, it has been possible to shorten the time 
      necessary to obtain osseointegration and, therefore, secondary stability on the
      part of implants. The surfaces, therefore, guarantee an improved cellular
      adhesion and thanks to the excellent wettability all the biological processes
      that derive from it, such as increases in the exposed implant surface, resulting 
      in an increase in bone-implant contact (BIC).

TI  - Micro-Scale Surface Patterning of Titanium Dental Implants by Anodization in the 
      Presence of Modifying Salts.

LID - 10.3390/ma12111753 [doi]
AB  - The bone-implant interface influences peri-implant bone healing and
      osseointegration. Among various nano-engineering techniques used for titanium
      surface modification, anodization is a simple, high-throughput and low-cost
      process, resulting in a nanoporous oxide coating which can promote
      osseointegration and impart antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. We
      anodized rounded tip dental implants of commercial grade titanium in aqueous
      phosphoric acid modified with calcium and potassium acetate, and characterized
      the resulting surface morphology and composition with scanning electron
      microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry. The appearance of nanopores on
      these implants confirmed successful nanoscale morphology modification.
      Additionally, the metal cations of the used salts were incorporated into the
      porous coating together with phosphate, which can be convenient for
      osseointegration. The proposed method for surface nanostructuring of titanium
      alloy could allow for fabrication of dental implants with improved
      biocompatibility in the next stage of research.

AB  - Variety of implant materials have been employed in various disciplines of medical
      science depending on the requirement of a particular application. Metals, alloys,
      ceramics, and polymers are the commonly used biomaterials. The main focus of this
      study is to review the various structural and microstructural properties of
      titanium and titanium based alloys used as orthopaedic implants. Orthopaedic
      implants need to possess certain important qualities to ensure their safe and
      effective use. These properties like the biocompatibility, relevant mechanical
      properties, high corrosion and wear resistance and osseointegration are
      summarized in this review. Various attempts to improve upon these properties like
      different processing routes, surface modifications have also been inculcated in
      the paper to provide an insight into the extent of research and effort that has
      been put into developing a highly superior titanium orthopaedic implant.

AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological fixation of a 3D
      printed porous implant, with and without different hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings, 
      in a canine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A canine transcortical model was used
      to evaluate the characteristics of bone ingrowth of Ti6Al4V cylindrical implants 
      fabricated using laser rapid manufacturing (LRM). At four and 12 weeks
      post-implantation, we performed histological analysis and mechanical push-out
      testing on three groups of implants: a HA-free control (LRM), LRM with
      precipitated HA (LRM-PA), and LRM with plasma-sprayed HA (LRM-PSHA). RESULTS:
      Substantial bone ingrowth was observed in all LRM implants, with and without HA, 
      at both time periods. Bone ingrowth increased from 42% to 52% at four weeks, to
      60% to 65% at 12 weeks. Mechanical tests indicated a minimum shear fixation
      strength of 20 MPa to 24 MPa at four weeks, and 34 MPa to 40 MPa at 12 weeks.
      There was no significant difference in the amount of bone ingrowth or in the
      shear strength between the three implant types at either time period. CONCLUSION:
      At four and 12 weeks, the 3D printed porous implants exhibited consistent bone
      ingrowth and high mechanical shear strength. Based on the results of this study, 
      we confirmed the suitability of this novel new additive manufacturing porous
      material for biological fixation by bone ingrowth. Cite this article: Bone Joint

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of alumina-blasted/acid-etched (AB/AE) or
      microabrasive blasting (C3-Microblasted) surface treatment on the
      osseointegration of commercially-pure Ti (grade II) and Ti-6Al-4V alloy (grade V)
      implants compared to as-machined surfaces. Surface characterization was performed
      by scanning electron microscopy and optical interferometry (IFM) to determine
      roughness parameters (Sa and Sq, n=3 per group). One-hundred forty-four implants 
      were placed in the radii of 12 beagle dogs, for histological (n=72,
      bone-to-implant contact - BIC and bone-area-fraction occupancy -BAFO) and torque 
      to interface failure test at 3 and 6 weeks (n=72). SEM and IFM revealed a
      significant increase in surface texture for AB/AE and C3-Microblasted surfaces
      compared to machined surface, regardless of titanium substrate.
      Torque-to-interface failure test showed significant increase in values from
      as-machined to AB/AE and to C3-Microblasted. Considering time in vivo, alloy
      grade, and surface treatment, the C3-microblasted presented higher mean BIC
      values relative to AB/AE and machined surfaces for both alloy types. BAFO levels 
      were significantly higher for both textured surfaces groups relative to the
      machined group at 3 weeks, but differences were not significant between the three
      surfaces for each alloy type at 6 weeks. Surface treatment resulted in roughness 
      that improved osseointegration in Grade II and V titanium substrates.

      implantation using HR-pQCT and digital volume correlation.

AB  - Primary press-fit fixation of femoral knee prostheses is obtained thanks to the
      inside dimensions of the implant being undersized with respect to the bone cuts
      created intra-operatively, dictated by a press-fit specified by the implant
      design. However, during prostheses press-fit implantation, high compressive and
      shear stresses at the implant-bone interface are generated, which causes
      permanent bone damage. The extent of this damage is unknown, but it may influence
      the implant stability and be a contributing factor to aseptic loosening, a main
      cause of revisions for knee arthroplasty. The aim of this ex-vivo study was to
      quantify, using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography
      (HR-pQCT) imaging and Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), permanent bone
      deformation due to press-fit femoral knee implantation of a commonly used
      implant. Six human cadaveric distal femora were resected and imaged with HR-pQCT 
      (60.7 mum/voxel, isotropic). Femurs were fitted with cementless femoral knee
      implants (Sigma PFC) and rescanned after implant removal. For each femur,
      permanent deformation was examined in the anterior, posterior-medial and
      posterior-lateral condyles for volumes of interest (VOIs) of 10mm depth. The bone
      volume fraction (BV/TV) for the VOIs in pre- and post-implantation images was
      calculated, at increasing depth from the bone surface. DVC was applied on the
      VOIs pre- and post-implantation, to assess trabecular bone displacements and
      plastically accumulated strains. The "BV/TVpost/BV/TVpre ratio vs. depth" showed,
      consistently among the six femurs, three consecutive points of interest at
      increasing bone depth, indicating: bone removal (ratio<100%), compaction
      (ratio>100%) and no changes (ratio=100%). Accordingly, the trabecular bone
      displacement computed by DVC suggested bone compaction up to 2.6+/-0.8mm in
      depth, with peak third principal strains of -162,100+/-55,000 muepsilon (mean
      absolute error: 1,000-2,000 muepsilon, SD: 200-500 muepsilon), well above the
      yield strain of bone (7,000-10,000 muepsilon). Combining 3D-imaging, at spatial
      resolutions obtainable with clinical HR-pQCT, and DVC, determines the extent of
      plastic deformation and accumulated compressive strains occurring within the bone
      due to femoral press-fit implantation. The methods and data presented can be used
      to compare different implants, implant surface coatings and press-fit values.
      These can also be used to advance and validate computational models by providing 
      information about the bone-implant interface obtained experimentally. Future
      studies using these methods can assist in determining the influence of bone
      damage on implant stability and the subsequent osseointegration.

TI  - Identifying the benefits and risks of emerging integration methods for upper limb
      prosthetic devices in the United States: an environmental scan.
LID - 10.1080/17434440.2019.1626231 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Upper limb loss greatly impacts one's productivity and quality of
      life. Despite a wealth of prosthetic device options, high user dissatisfaction
      and rejection rates persist. Novel connective and control methods between a
      device and end-user have large potential rewards and risks, making economic
      evaluation difficult. We sought to identify the benefits and harms of integration
      technologies in upper limb prosthetic devices. Such information can inform
      economic evaluation, including the development of a stated-preference instrument.
      Methods: An environmental scan was done to assess user perspectives on
      advancements in upper-limb prosthetic device integration. The environmental scan 
      consisted of a PubMed keyword literature search, grey literature review,
      formation of a community advisory board (CAB), and key informant interviews with 
      CAB members. The CAB guided this study and was comprised of adults with personal 
      or professional experiences with upper limb prostheses. Results: The
      environmental scan highlights 4 main types of integration in upper limb
      prostheses: osseointegration, targeted muscle reinnervation, cortical
      integration, and peripheral nerve/muscle integration. The PubMed literature
      search resulted in the most matches for "targeted muscle reinnervation upper
      limb" (N=65) and "upper limb osseointegration" (N=54). The grey literature review
      found targeted muscle reinnervation and peripheral nerve integration to be most
      discussed amongst end-users and regulators. Of these four emerging methods,
      greater device control versus invasiveness of implant is a clear benefit-risk
      tradeoff. Conclusion: This scan highlights the gap in user-centered research in
      upper limb prosthetic devices. Future directions include the development of a
      stated-preference instrument incorporating these methods of integration.

TI  - Cigarette Smoke Extract Exposure: Effects on the Interactions between Titanium
      Surface and Osteoblasts.
PG  - 8759568
LID - 10.1155/2019/8759568 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the changes in the characteristics of
      titanium surface and the osteoblast-titanium interactions under cigarette smoke
      extract (CSE) exposure. In this study, CSE was used to simulate the oral liquid
      environment around the implant under cigarette smoke exposure. Titanium samples
      were immersed in CSE to explore the changes in the characteristics of titanium
      surface. The physical properties of titanium surface were measured, including
      surface micromorphology, surface elemental composition, roughness, and surface
      hydrophilicity. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured on the titanium surface in vitro
      under different concentrations of CSE exposure, and cell adhesion, cell
      proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation were observed. The surface
      micromorphology and elemental composition of titanium surface changed under CSE
      exposure. No obvious changes were found in the surface roughness and the
      hydrophilicity of titanium samples. Moreover, the results of in vitro study
      showed that CSE exposure downregulated the cell spreading, proliferation, and
      osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells on the titanium surface. It could be
      speculated that some carbon-containing compounds from CSE adsorbed on the
      titanium surface and the osteoblast-titanium interactions were influenced under
      CSE exposure. It is hoped that these results could provide valuable information
      for further studies on smoking-mediated inhibition of implants osseointegration.

TI  - Cytocompatible and Anti-bacterial Adhesion Nanotextured Titanium Oxide Layer on
      Titanium Surfaces for Dental and Orthopedic Implants.
PG  - 103
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2019.00103 [doi]
AB  - It is widely recognized that surface nanotextures applied on a biomaterial can
      affect wettability, protein absorption and cellular and/or bacterial adhesion;
      accordingly, they are nowadays of great interest to promote fast osseointegration
      and to maintain physiological healing around biomedical implants. In order to be 
      suitable for clinical applications, surface nanotextures must be not only safe
      and effective, but also, they should be produced through industrial processes
      scalable to real devices with sustainable processes and costs: this is often a
      barrier to the market entry. Based on these premises, a chemical surface
      treatment designed for titanium and its alloys able to produce an oxide layer
      with a peculiar sponge like nanotexture coupled with high density of hydroxyl
      group is here presented. The modified Ti-based surfaces previously showed
      inorganic bioactivity intended as the ability to induce apatite precipitation in 
      simulated body fluid. Physicochemical properties and morphology of the obtained
      layers have been characterized by means of FESEM, XPS, and Zeta-potential.
      Biological response to osteoblasts progenitors and bacteria has been tested. The 
      here proposed nanotextured surfaces successfully supported osteoblasts
      progenitors' adhesion, proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition thus
      demonstrating good biocompatibility. Moreover, the nanotexture was able to
      significantly reduce bacteria surface colonization when the orthopedic and the
      periodontal pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Aggregatibacter
      actinomycetemcomitans strains were applied for a short time. Finally, the
      applicability of the proposed surface treatment to real biomedical devices (a 3D 
      acetabular cup, a dental screw and a micro-sphered laryngeal implant) has been
      here demonstrated.

TI  - A Biomechanical Comparison of Four Hip Arthroplasty Designs in a Canine Model.
LID - 10.1055/s-0039-1691836 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an in vitro biomechanical
      protocol for canine cementless hip arthroplasty that represents physiological
      gait loading (compression and torsion) and to evaluate if three alternative
      implant designs improve fixation compared with the traditional collarless,
      tapered stem in the clinically challenging case of moderate canal flare index.
      STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four (six/group) laboratory-prepared canine constructs were 
      tested using a simulated gait and overload (failure) protocol. Construct
      stiffness, failure load/displacement and migration were measured as outcome
      variables. RESULTS: Simulated gait loading did not show any significant
      differences between implant types for peak displacement, peak rotation, torsional
      stiffness, subsidence or inducible displacement. The collared and collarless stem
      groups were stiffer in compression compared with the collarless with a lateral
      bolt and short-stem groups. Increasing the loading above simulated gait showed
      significant reductions in compressive and torsional stiffness for all implant
      constructs. Despite the reductions, the short-stem group showed significantly
      higher stiffness compared with the other three groups. CONCLUSION: Peak failure
      loads (compressive and torsional) in this study were approximately four to seven 
      times the simulated gait loading (430 N, 1.6 Nm) regardless of implant type and
      highlight the importance of limiting activity level (trotting, jumping) following
      hip replacement in the postoperative period and during the osseointegration of
      the implant.

TI  - Antiadipogenesis and Osseointegration of Strontium-Doped Implant Surfaces.
PG  - 22034519850574
LID - 10.1177/0022034519850574 [doi]
AB  - The decreased bone density and increased marrow adiposity that occur with aging
      may influence the outcome of dental implants. Strontium (Sr), an anabolic agent
      for the treatment of osteoporosis, has an inhibitory effect on adipogenesis but
      favors osteogenesis of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs).
      However, little is known about the effects and mechanisms of local Sr release on 
      adipogenesis during bone formation in aged bone. In this study, a potential
      dental implant material, Sr-doped titanium, was developed via a sandblasted,
      large-grit, and acid-etched (SLA) method combined with a hydrothermal process.
      The effects of Sr-SLA on initial adhesion, proliferation, intracellular redox
      state, and adipogenic differentiation of senescent BMSCs were investigated. The
      in vitro results showed that Sr-SLA promoted spreading of senescent BMSCs via
      upregulation of the gene and protein expression of integrin beta1. In addition,
      it was revealed that Sr-SLA could reduce intracellular oxidative stress by
      decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species and oxygen radicals and
      increasing the content of glutathione peroxidase. More important, Sr-SLA
      suppressed lipid droplet production and adipokines expression via downregulation 
      of transcription peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and
      signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, thus inhibiting adipogenesis.
      Finally, the Sr-SLA implants were implanted in tibiae of aged (18-mo-old)
      Sprague-Dawley rats for 2 and 8 wk. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that 
      Sr-SLA implants significantly enhanced osseointegration, and the inhibition
      effect on marrow adipose tissue formation was moderate. All these results suggest
      that due to the multiple functions produced by Sr, antiadipogenesis capability
      and rapid osseointegration were enhanced by the Sr-SLA coatings, which have
      potential application in dental implantation in the aged population.

TI  - Reconstruction and Implant-Supported Rehabilitation of an Iatrogenically Caused
      Maxillary Alveolar Defect.
LID - 10.1097/ID.0000000000000910 [doi]
AB  - Defects of the oral and maxillofacial region may arise from several reasons such 
      as trauma, infection, cyst, tumor, medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw,
      and misuse of some irritant agents. For reconstruction, autogenous grafts remain 
      the gold standard among the alternatives. In our case, a 42-year-old woman
      referred to our clinic for implant-supported fixed bridge rehabilitation of her
      edentulous and defected left 2nd premolar and 1st molar region. In examinations, 
      devitalizing agent-dependent large defect was observed. Anterior iliac crest
      (AIC) grafting technique was preferred for reconstruction. Consecutively, 16-week
      bone healing and 3-month implant osseointegration periods were uneventful. After 
      fabrication of the implant-supported fixed bridge, the patient was followed up
      for 2.5 years with no signs of bone resorption, gingival inflammation, and pain. 
      AIC grafting and implant-borne fixed bridges seem stable and satisfactory methods
      for large maxillofacial defects.

AB  - The main aim of this review study was to report the state of art on the
      nano-scale technological advancements on titanium implant surfaces to enhance the
      osseointegration process. Several methods of surface modification are
      chronologically described bridging ordinary methods (e.g. grit blasting and
      etching) and advanced physicochemical approaches such as 3D-laser texturing and
      biomimetic modification. Functionalization procedures by using proteins,
      peptides, and bioactive ceramics have provided an enhancement in wettability and 
      bioactivity of implant surfaces. Furthermore, recent findings have revealed a
      combined beneficial effect of micro- and nano-scale modification and biomimetic
      functionalization of titanium surfaces. However, some technological developments 
      of implant surfaces are not commercially available yet due to costs and a lack of
      clinical validation for such recent surfaces. Further in vitro and in vivo
      studies are required to endorse the use of enhanced biomimetic implant surfaces. 
      STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The main aim of this review study was to report the
      state of art on nano-scale technological advances of titanium implant surfaces to
      accelerate the osseointegration process. Several methods of surface modification 
      are reported in literature ranging from ordinary methods (e.g. grit blasting and 
      etching procedures) up to advanced physicochemical approaches such as 3D-laser
      printing and biomimetic functionalization. An enhancement of wettability and
      bioactivity of titanium implant surfaces has been accomplished by combining micro
      and nano-scale modification and functionalization with protein, peptides, and
      bioactive compounds. Such morphological and chemical modification of the titanium
      surfaces induce the migration and differentiation of osteogenic cells followed by
      an enhancement of the mineral matrix formation that speed up the osseointegration
      process. Additionally, the incorporation of bioactive molecules into the
      nanostructured surfaces is a promising strategy to avoid early and late implant
      failures induced by the biofilm accumulation.

TI  - In Vitro Examination of the Use of Er:YAG Laser to Retrieve Lithium Disilicate
      Crowns from Titanium Implant Abutments.
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13077 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Removal of cement-retained implant crowns can be difficult and often
      requires sectioning of the prosthesis by rotary instruments. This study aimed to 
      measure how much time is required in crown removal and the temperature changes
      when erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) laser was used to retrieve
      lithium disilicate crowns from titanium implant abutments luted with composite
      resin cement and resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI). MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Forty identical lithium disilicate crowns were fabricated for prefabricated
      titanium abutments. Composite resin (CR) and RMGI cements were used to lute the
      crowns, 20 specimens for each cement. Specimens were kept in 100% humidity for 48
      hours. Er:YAG laser was then used to facilitate the crown retrieval. The
      retrieval time was recorded. The temperature changes at the abutment level for
      each type of cement were recorded during irradiation of 10 specimens for each
      type of cement from 1 to 10 minutes. Data were analyzed using paired t-test (a = 
      0.05). The surfaces of the crown and the abutment were further examined using
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: The average times of crown removal
      from titanium abutments were 196.5 seconds for CR and 97.5 seconds for RMGI
      groups with statistical significance (p < 0.001). The temperatures measured from 
      1 to 10 minutes of irradiation ranged from 18 degrees to 20.8 degrees for CR and 
      18 degrees to 23 degrees for RMGI at the abutment surface, and 22.1 degrees to
      24.6 degrees for CR and 22 degrees to 24.8 degrees for RMGI at the crown surface.
      No statistical differences were observed between temperature changes at the
      abutment or the crown for each cement (p = 0.63); however there was a
      statistically significant difference between the temperatures at the abutment and
      crown for both cements (p < 0.001). SEM examination showed no visible damage
      caused by treatment with Er:YAG laser. CONCLUSIONS: It is faster to remove
      lithium disilicate crowns from titanium implant abutments when luted with RMGI
      compared to CR cement. The temperature rise was higher in the crown compared to
      the abutment. The type of cement had no effects on temperature changes. Heat
      generated from Er:YAG irradiation does not appear to be high enough to have any
      adverse effect on implant osseointegration. This article is protected by

TI  - Design, manufacture, and fatigue analysis of lightweight hip implants.
PG  - 2280800019836830
LID - 10.1177/2280800019836830 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to design, analyze and manufacture lightweight hip
      implants which have sufficient fatigue performance to enable use in total hip
      arthroplasty (THA). METHODS: The lattice structure was applied on an implant
      geometry, which is frequently used in THA, to provide a reduction in mass and
      increase flexibility. The implant surfaces were roughened using semispherical
      pores to improve the osseointegration. The specimens were manufactured by means
      of direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) and fatigue tests were performed according
      to ISO 7206-4:2010. Moreover, fatigue analyses of the designed implants were
      numerically carried out using the finite element method. RESULTS: The applied
      lattice structure on implant geometry leads to 15-17% reduction in the masses of 
      implants compared to a solid one. It has also been determined that the
      lightweight implants show more flexible behavior with increasing pore diameter
      used on the implant surfaces while keeping the lattice structure geometry
      constant. The fatigue test and finite element analysis (FEA) results are in
      reasonable agreement. In addition, additively manufactured solid implants have
      exhibited similar fatigue performance with one produced by conventional methods. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents design, analysis, manufacturing and fatigue test
      processes of lightweight hip implants. The lattice structure and the
      semispherical pores were applied on a reference implant geometry and they were
      manufactured by DMLS. The fatigue tests and FEA were performed to evaluate newly 
      designed implant performance. All the implants successfully completed the fatigue
      tests without any damage.

TI  - Enhancing osteoblast functions on biofilm-contaminated titanium alloy by
      concentration-dependent use of methylene blue-mediated antimicrobial photodynamic
      therapy.
LID - S1572-1000(19)30076-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.pdpdt.2019.05.021 [doi]
AB  - The concentration of methylene blue (MB) photosensitizer could affect the
      eradication efficacy of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) in the
      treatment of contaminated implants, which is linked to the osseointegration of
      the implant. This was the first report of evaluating osteoblast functions on the 
      contaminated SLA (sandblasting, large-grit and acid-etching) Ti alloy surfaces
      after the concentration-dependent use of MB-aPDT. Totally 1,164 SLA discs were
      randomly distributed for the analyses of antibacterial efficacy and osteoblast
      functions. Gram-negative (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; A.
      actinomycetemcomitans) or Gram-positive (Streptococcus mutans; S. mutans) adhered
      on disc samples was subjected to aPDT with different MB concentrations (200, 250,
      300, 350, and 400 mug/mL) using 660 nm diode laser with maximum output 80 mW for 
      1 min irradiation (4.8 J/cm(2)). Bactericidal effect was examined by viability,
      morphology, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) assays. The disinfected disc surfaces by
      MB-aPDT to support osteoblast-like MG63 attachment, proliferation,
      differentiation, and mineralization were assessed for the predetermined culture
      time intervals. The statistical differences between the means were performed
      using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc Scheffe test. The
      results of the morphology observation and bacterial survival examination
      consistently indicated a remarkably lower quantity of bacterial colonies on
      biofilm-contaminated surfaces after the aPDT treatment with higher MB
      concentration. Similarly, the higher MB concentration in aPDT resulted in the
      lower LPS amounts remaining on the A. actinomycetemcomitans-contaminated
      surfaces. Intriguingly, the expression of osteoblast cultured on disinfected
      surfaces using aPDT with higher MB concentration was comparable to the control
      without contamination. Within the limits of this in vitro model, this formulation
      of 400 mug/mL MB used in aPDT may be not only the lethal concentration against
      the 2 bacteria-contaminated implants, but it could also enhance the osteoblast
      functions on the contaminated implants. Nevertheless, the efficacy in the
      clinical practice for peri-implantitis therapy remains to be studied.

TI  - The Effects of Systemic Diseases and Medications on Implant Osseointegration: A
      Systematic Review.
PG  - s35-s49
LID - 10.11607/jomi.19suppl.g3 [doi]
AB  - Since their development, dental implants have become one of the most common
      procedures to rehabilitate patients with single missing teeth or fully edentulous
      jaws. As implants become more mainstream, determining the factors that affect
      osseointegration is extremely important. Medical risk factors identified to
      negatively affect osseointegration include diabetes and osteoporosis. However,
      other systemic conditions and medications that interfere with wound healing have 
      not been as widely investigated. The aim of this systematic review was to
      evaluate the effect of systemic disorders including diabetes and osteoporosis on 
      implant osseointegration. The aim was also to evaluate the effect of other
      diseases, such as neurocognitive diseases, cardiovascular disease, human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and
      medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), proton pump
      inhibitors (PPIs), and antihypertensives. Although the literature does not
      demonstrate that diabetes negatively affects implant osseointegration, most
      studies focus on well-controlled diabetics and the use of prophylactic
      antibiotics. In addition, studies have shown increased long-term bone and soft
      tissue complications. For osteoporosis, recent studies and reviews also fail to
      demonstrate a lower osseointegration rate. However, caution must be exercised in 
      these patients due to the risk for osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ), especially in
      patients with bone malignancies. There is also no direct evidence that patients
      with HIV, cardiovascular disease, neurologic disorders, hypothyroidism, or
      rheumatoid arthritis have a decreased rate of implant osseointegration. However, 
      some preliminary evidence suggests that medications such as SSRIs or PPIs may
      have a negative effect on implant osseointegration. These studies are fairly
      recent and must be validated with continuous research. Moreover, disease control,
      concomitant medications, and other comorbidities complicate implant
      osseointegration and must guide our treatment approaches and clinical guidelines.

TI  - Relationship Between Primary/Mechanical and Secondary/Biological Implant
      Stability.
PG  - s7-s23
LID - 10.11607/jomi.19suppl.g1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This systematic review was prepared as part of the Academy of
      Osseointegration (AO) 2018 Summit, held August 8-10 in Oak Brook Hills, Illinois,
      to assess the relationship between the primary (mechanical) and secondary
      (biological) implant stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic and manual
      searches were conducted by two independent examiners in order to address the
      following issues. Meta-regression analyses explored the relationship between
      primary stability, as measured by insertion torque (IT) and implant stability
      quotient (ISQ), and secondary stability, by means of survival and peri-implant
      marginal bone loss (MBL). RESULTS: Overall, 37 articles were included for
      quantitative assessment. Of these, 17 reported on implant stability using only
      resonance frequncy analysis (RFA), 11 used only IT data, 7 used a combination of 
      RFA and IT, and 2 used only the Periotest. The following findings were reached:
      .Relationship between primary and secondary implant stability: Strong positive
      statistically significant relationship (P < .001). .Relationship between primary 
      stability by means of ISQ and implant survival: No statistically significant
      relationship (P = .4). .Relationship between IT and implant survival: No
      statistically significant relationship (P = .2). .Relationship between primary
      stability by means of ISQ unit and MBL: No statistically significant relationship
      (P = .9). .Relationship between IT and MBL: Positive statistically significant
      relationship (P = .02). .Accuracy of methods and devices to assess implant
      stability: Insufficient data to address this issue. CONCLUSION: Data suggest that
      primary/mechanical stability leads to more efficient achievement of
      secondary/biological stability, but the achievement of high primary stability
      might be detrimental for bone level stability. While current methods/devices for 
      tracking implant stability over time can be clinically useful, a robust
      connection between existing stability metrics with implant survival remains
      inconclusive.

AB  - Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is considered a potential orthopedic/dental material 
      because of its excellent mechanical and chemical properties (e.g., similar
      elastic modulus to that of human bone). However, the poor bacteriostasis and
      anti-inflammatory and osseointegrative properties of bioinert PEEK impede its
      clinical application. We previously developed a facile and versatile surface
      modification method using dexamethasone plus minocycline-loaded liposomes
      (Dex/Mino liposomes) bonded by a mussel-inspired polydopamine coating, which
      effectively modulated cell inflammatory response and discouraged bacterial
      colonization in vitro. Herein, we report the application of this multifunctional 
      surface modification method to improve bioinert PEEK, aimed at further studying
      the in vitro osteogenesis and in vivo properties of Dex/Mino liposome-modified
      PEEK to prevent bacterial contamination, attenuate the inflammatory response, and
      enhance ossification for physiologic osseointegration. Our study established that
      the Dex/Mino liposome-modified PEEK surface presented favorable stability and
      cytocompatibility. Compared with bare PEEK, improved osteogenic differentiation
      of human mesenchymal stem cells under both osteoinductive and osteoconductive
      conditions was found on the functionalized surface due to the liposomal Dex
      releasing. In vivo bacteriostasis assay confirmed that Mino released from the
      functionalized surface provided an effective antibacterial effect. Moreover, the 
      subcutaneous foreign body reaction and beagle femur implantation models
      corroborated the enhanced anti-inflammatory and osteointegrative properties of
      the functionalized PEEK. Our findings indicate that the developed Dex/Mino
      liposome-modified PEEK with enhanced antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and
      osseointegrative capacity has great potential as an orthopedic/dental implant
      material for clinical application.

TI  - Systemic sclerostin antibody treatment increases osseointegration and
      biomechanical competence of zoledronic-acid-coated dental implants in a rat
      osteoporosis model.
PG  - 333-346
LID - 10.22203/eCM.v037a20 [doi]
AB  - Osseointegration of dental implants can be promoted by implant-surface
      modifications using bisphosphonate coatings. In addition, it is of clinical
      interest to promote peri-implant bone formation and to restore bony structure in 
      low bone-mass patients. The present study evaluated a combination of an
      anti-resorptive zoledronic acid (ZOL) implant-coating and a systemically applied 
      sclerostin antibody, a known bone anabolic treatment principle, versus sole
      sclerostin antibody treatment or ZOL implant-coating in a rat osteoporosis model.
      Uncoated reference surface implants or ZOL-coated implants (n = 64/group) were
      inserted into the proximal tibia of aged osteoporotic rats three months following
      ovariectomy. 32 animals of each group received once weekly sclerostin antibody
      therapy. Osseointegration was assessed 2 or 4 weeks post-implantation by ex vivo 
      microCT, histology and biomechanical testing. Overall implant survival rate was
      97 %. Histomorphology revealed pronounced bone formation along the entire implant
      length of ZOL-coated implants. At 4 weeks following implant insertion,
      bone-implant contact, cancellous bone mineral density and bone volume/tissue
      volume were significantly increased for the combination of ZOL and sclerostin
      antibody as compared to sclerostin antibody or ZOL implant-coating alone. Removal
      torque was also significantly increased in the combination therapy group relative
      to animals receiving only sclerostin antibody therapy or ZOL-coated implants. In 
      an osteoporotic rat model, the combination of anti-resorptive ZOL implant-coating
      and systemically applied sclerostin antibody led to significantly increased
      peri-implant bone formation. Therefore, the combination of ZOL and the
      osteoanabolic sclerostin antibody was more effective than either agent alone.

TI  - An experimental investigation of the effects of chronic stress on bone-to-implant
      contact.
PG  - 91-96
LID - 10.5125/jkaoms.2019.45.2.91 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic restraint
      stress on the osseointegration of titanium implants. Materials and Methods:
      Twenty adult male Wistar albino rats were used in the study. After surgical
      insertion of titanium implants into the metaphyseal part of the tibial bone, rats
      were randomly divided into two groups: a control group (CNT group) and an
      experimental restraint stress group (RS group). In the CNT group, titanium
      implants were inserted surgically, and rats received no further treatment during 
      the 47-day experimental period. In the RS group, restraint stress was applied for
      3 hours per day for 45 days, beginning 2 days after implant surgery. Weight of
      the rats was measured prior to surgery and at the end of the study to analyze the
      effects of stress. At the end of the experimental period, rats were euthanized,
      and implants and surrounding bone tissues were used for undecalcified
      histological analysis. Serum cortisol levels were assessed in cardiac blood
      samples from the rats following centrifugation. Results: Average weight of rats
      in the RS group was lower than that of rats in the CNT group after the
      experimental protocol had been completed (P<0.05). Further, serum cortisol levels
      were higher in the RS group than in the CNT group (P<0.05). There were no
      significant differences in bone-implant connection levels between the two groups 
      (P>0.05). Conclusion: The data analyzed in this study suggest that chronic
      restraint stress did not adversely affect rats during a 45-day osseointegration
      period.

TI  - Strontium-incorporated titanium implant surface treated by hydrothermal reactions
      promotes early bone osseointegration in osteoporotic rabbits.
LID - 10.1111/clr.13460 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of
      strontium-modified implant surfaces on promoting early bone osseointegration in
      osteoporotic rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The surface topographies, chemical
      elements, contact angles and ionic releases of the SLA and SLA-Sr sample were
      analysed by special instruments separately. Sixteen ovariectomized New Zealand
      rabbits received glucocorticoid administration, and sixteen SHAM rabbits were
      used as controls. After generating a successful osteoporosis-induced model, SLA
      and SLA-Sr implants were randomly inserted into the tibia and femur metaphysis of
      each animal. The rabbits were sacrificed after 3 and 6 weeks of bone healing,
      then removal torque values (RTVs), percentage of bone area (BA%) and percentage
      of bone-implant contact (BIC%) were analysed for the SLA-Sr and SLA implants.
      RESULTS: Multiple nanostructures were found on the Sr-incorporated titanium
      surface, and appropriate amounts of strontium ions from the SLA-Sr surface were
      released into the surrounding tissue within 21 days. In vivo, SLA-Sr implants
      displayed much more new bone around their surfaces than the SLA implants.
      Significantly higher RTVs and BIC% were observed for the SLA-Sr implants than for
      the SLA implants in both osteoporotic (P < 0.01) and healthy animals (P < 0.01)
      at 3 and 6 weeks. The SLA-Sr implants exhibited higher BA% in cortical (P < 0.01)
      and cancellous bone (P < 0.05) than the SLA implants in osteoporotic rabbits at 3
      weeks. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that Sr-incorporated surfaces treated through
      hydrothermal reactions have positive effects on promoting early osseointegration 
      in both osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic rabbits. This article is protected by

      invasiveness. This article provides an overview of robotic surgery and its
      current applications in oral and maxillofacial surgery and implant dentistry.
      Robotic surgery is constantly evolving, and its applications are continuously
      expanding. Recently, robot-assisted surgery has been used for dental implant
      placement. In the United States, the first robotic dental surgery system was
      cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for dental implant procedures in
      2017. At the end of 2017, the world's first autonomous dental implant placement
      system was developed by Zhao and colleagues in China. This so-called intelligent 
      robot has a high degree of autonomy, can automatically adjust during
      intraoperative procedures, and can execute surgical tasks directly on patients
      without any apparent control by a surgeon.

TI  - IMPROVED DESIGN OF TEMPORARY PROSTHESIS FOR THE BONE AUGMENTATION AND TWO-STAGE
      DENTAL IMPLANTS OSSEOINTEGRATION PERIOD.
PG  - 37-39
AB  - The study was performed on 21 edentulous patients, treated during the period of
      2017 - 2018 at the Surgical Dentistry Department at the Moscow State University
      of Medicine and Dentistry. The patients underwent the procedures of bone
      augmentation, dental implant placement, and placement of various design temporary
      dentures for the periods preceding the placement of the permanent
      implant-supported dentures. The authors have developed and implemented a
      medical-prophylactic device - an acrylic partial denture supported by temporary
      dental implant and Klammer fixation on the existing crowns in front of the
      edentulous area. The results of the use of the device during the post-operative
      period were analyzed and compared to those of traditionally designed removable
      partial devices. The comparative analysis has shown that the medical-prophylactic
      device is superior to the temporary removable partial dentures and vacuum-formed 
      retainers.

AB  - The osseointegration and survival of dental implants are linked to primary
      stability. Good primary stability relies on the mechanical friction between
      implant surface and surrounding bone with absence of mobility in the osteotomy
      site immediately after implant placement. Several factors have been found to
      affect implant primary stability, including bone density, implant design, and
      surgical technique. Various methods have been used to assess implant primary
      stability including insertion torque and resonance frequency analysis. This
      article aims to evaluate the success of osseointegration in the absence of
      primary stability and to propose recommendations to manage implants that lack
      primary stability.

AB  - Implant surface micro and macro topography plays a key role in early
      osseointegration. The physicochemical features of the implant surface (ie,
      chemical composition, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and roughness) influence the 
      deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, the precipitation of bone mineral,
      and the stimulation of cells. Modification of the implant topography provides
      better primary stability and faster osseointegration, allowing for immediate
      placement or immediate loading. Randomized clinical trials are warranted to
      compare the response of osseointegration with various implant micro and macro
      surface topographies in people with various local or systemic risk factors.

TI  - Kriging Surrogate Model for Resonance Frequency Analysis of Dental Implants by a 
      Latin Hypercube-Based Finite Element Method.
PG  - 3768695
LID - 10.1155/2019/3768695 [doi]
AB  - The dental implantation in clinical operations often encounters difficulties and 
      challenges of failure in osseointegration, bone formulation, and remodeling. The 
      resonance frequency (RF) can effectively describe the stability of the implant in
      physical experiments or numerical simulations. However, the exact relationship
      between the design variables of dental implants and RF of the system is
      correlated, complicated, and dependent. In this study, an appropriate
      mathematical model is proposed to evaluate and predict the implant stability and 
      performance. The model has merits not only in the prediction reliability and
      accuracy but also in the compatibility and flexibility, in both experimental data
      and numerical simulation results. The Kriging surrogate model is proposed to
      present the numerical relationship between RF and material parameters of dental
      implants. The Latin Hypercube (LH) sampling method as a competent and
      sophisticated method is applied and combined with the finite element method
      (FEM). The methods developed in this paper provide helpful guidance for designers
      and researchers in the implantation design and surgical plans.

TI  - The Fate of Osteoblast-Like MG-63 Cells on Pre-Infected Bactericidal
      Nanostructured Titanium Surfaces.
LID - E1575 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma12101575 [doi]
AB  - Biomaterials that have been newly implanted inside the body are the substratum
      targets for a "race for the surface", in which bacterial cells compete against
      eukaryotic cells for the opportunity to colonize the surface. A victory by the
      former often results in biomaterial-associated infections, which can be a serious
      threat to patient health and can undermine the function and performance of the
      implant. Moreover, bacteria can often have a 'head start' if implant
      contamination has taken place either prior to or during the surgery. Current
      prevention and treatment strategies often rely on systemic antibiotic therapies, 
      which are becoming increasingly ineffective due to a growing prevalence of
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Nanostructured surfaces that kill bacteria by
      physically rupturing bacterial cells upon contact have recently emerged as a
      promising solution for the mitigation of bacterial colonization of implants.
      Furthermore, these nanoscale features have been shown to enhance the adhesion and
      proliferation of eukaryotic cells, which is a key to, for example, the successful
      osseointegration of load-bearing titanium implants. The bactericidal activity and
      biocompatibility of such nanostructured surfaces are often, however, examined
      separately, and it is not clear to what extent bacterial cell-surface
      interactions would affect the subsequent outcomes of host-cell attachment and
      osseointegration processes. In this study, we investigated the ability of
      bactericidal nanostructured titanium surfaces to support the attachment and
      growth of osteoblast-like MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells, despite them having
      been pre-infected with pathogenic bacteria. MG-63 is a commonly used osteoblastic
      model to study bone cell viability, adhesion, and proliferation on the surfaces
      of load-bearing biomaterials, such as titanium. The nanostructured titanium
      surfaces used here were observed to kill the pathogenic bacteria, whilst
      simultaneously enhancing the growth of MG-63 cells in vitro when compared to that
      occurring on sterile, flat titanium surfaces. These results provide further
      evidence in support of nanostructured bactericidal surfaces being used as a
      strategy to help eukaryotic cells win the "race for the surface" against
      bacterial cells on implant materials.

TI  - The effect of hyperlipidemia on bone graft regeneration of peri-implantal created
      defects in rabbits.

AB  - AIM: It is reported that hyperlipidemia affects quality and density of bone and
      adversely affects wound healing. The effect of hyperlipidemia on implant
      osseointegration and peri-implant defect regeneration has not been fully
      explained. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of hyperlipidemia
      on the healing potential of the materials used for peri-implant bone regeneration
      and implant stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve male, New Zealand rabbits
      were used in this study. Half of the rabbits were fed a 2% cholesterol diet for 8
      weeks to induce hypercholesterolemia. Peri-implant defects (7 mm diameter) were
      created in the tibias of rabbits and placed implants (3.3 mm in diameter). This
      study was conducted as a split-mouth design. Animals were randomly divided into
      two groups: (1) hypercholesterol+autogenous graft group and
      hypercholesterol+xenograft group (n = 6), and (2) autogenous graft and xenograft 
      groups as controls (n = 6). At 8 weeks after surgery, the rabbits were
      euthanized. During implant surgery and at 8 weeks, implant stability was measured
      with resonance frequency analysis (RFA values). Bone-to-implant contact (BIC) was
      analyzed via histomorphometric analysis. RESULTS: Hyperlipidemic groups showed
      significantly lower BIC values than those of the control groups at 8 weeks (p <
      0.05). According to baseline RFA readings, there was no significant difference
      between control and hyperlipidemic groups (p > 0.05). The
      hypercholesterol+autogenous graft group had significantly lower RFA readings and 
      BIC values than the hypercholesterol+xenograft group at 8 weeks (p < 0.05).
      CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, it was found that
      hyperlipidemia may negatively affect the implant stability especially in the
      autogenous group and also, may decrease peri-implant bone regeneration. However, 
      further studies are necessary to confirm these results more.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4
      inhibitor used to treat type II diabetes, on bone tissue and on implant
      osseointegration in diabetic rats. DESIGN: Thirty-two male rats were divided into
      four groups: 1) Diabetic animals (GD); 2) Diabetic animals that received
      sitagliptin (GDS); 3) Normoglycemic animals (GN); and 4) Normoglycemic animals
      that received sitagliptin (GNS). All animals received titanium implants in the
      right tibia. Sitagliptin or water were administered for 4 weeks. Glycemia,
      HOMA-IR, insulinemia, microtomographic parameters of the left tibia and implant
      bone area fraction occupancy (BAFO) of the right tibia were evaluated. RESULTS:
      The model used to induce diabetes led to hyperglycemia. However, HOMA-IR results 
      showed no insulin resistance, and insulinemia was lower in diabetic animals,
      demonstrating the development of type I diabetes. Sitagliptin administration did 
      not influence glycemic control. The diabetic animals showed a lower BAFO and bone
      volume fraction, as well as a lower trabecular number and thickness, revealing
      the deleterious effect of diabetes on bone metabolism and osseointegration.
      CONCLUSION: In this model, sitagliptin administration did not reverse the
      negative effects of type I diabetes on bone, suggesting that sitagliptin has no
      direct action on bone tissue and has no protective bone action in decompensated
      diabetic animals.

AB  - In this study, we explored a ternary dopant system utilizing 0.25wt% ZnO to
      induce osteogenesis, 0.5wt% SiO2 to induce angiogenesis, and 2.0wt% Ag2O to
      provide secondary infection control within a plasma assisted hydroxyapatite
      coating for orthopaedic or dental applications. The objective of this study was
      to understand the effects of ZnO, SiO2, and Ag2O dopants on the mechanical and
      biological properties of hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings on titanium (Ti). Coatings 
      were deposited using a 30kW plasma spray system equipped with a supersonic nozzle
      to produce above standard coating bond strengths of 24+/-2MPa on Ti6Al4V and
      22+/-1MPa on commercially pure Ti substrates. Antibacterial properties were
      revealed in vitro against E. coli and S. aureus. The ternary dopant system was
      implanted in 18 male Sprague-Dawley rats with timepoints of 5 and 10weeks. By
      week 5, ZnSiAg-HA produced 32% bone mineralization of 68% total bone formation
      compared to only 11% bone mineralization of 55% total bone formation in the
      undoped coating. This system can be employed for replacement surgeries and
      revision surgeries to reduce healing time and enhance osseointegration. STATEMENT
      OF SIGNIFICANCE: Total hip replacements increased 124% from 2000 to 2010 with an 
      ever-increasing rate due to the rise in average life span and an escalation in
      surgeries for young patients. Replacement surgeries come with the risk of
      rejection, poor integration, and infection. This study incorporates biologically 
      relevant metallic oxides of ZnO, SiO2, and Ag2O within a hydroxyapatite coating
      on titanium deposited using a radio frequency induction plasma spray. A ternary
      dopant system has not been explored in the current literature and little is known
      about these particular dopants in vivo. This proposed system can be employed for 
      replacement surgeries to lower healing time and enhance osseointegration between 
      implant and host tissue.

TI  - Digital imaging evaluation of the scapula for prediction of endosteal implant
      placement in reconstruction of oromandibular defects with scapular free flaps.
LID - 10.1002/micr.30466 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dental implant placement in scapular free flaps is challenging. This
      study examines the scapula with computed tomography to identify ideal locations
      for predictable implant placement during preoperative planning. METHODS:
      Sixty-eight adult patient chest CT scans (34 men, 34 women) captured for various 
      medical indications, were analyzed for age, height, weight, and scapula length.
      The lateral border of the scapula was divided into six equal segments; the
      midpoints of each segment (labeled proximally to distally as 1M-6M) were analyzed
      in cross-section as potential recipient sites for 3.5 x 8 mm implants. Also, we
      present a case of a 77-year-old male with ameloblastoma of the mandible who
      underwent patient specific planning and received a scapular free flap with dental
      implant placement. RESULTS: There was greater bone availability in males with a
      mean depth of 8.3 +/- 2.8 versus 5.1 +/- 3.3 mm in females (p < .01). The
      proximal portion (1M) of the scapula in males and females had depths of 11.3 +/- 
      1.5 and 9.5 +/- 2.3 mm, respectively. Males had depths of 8.4 +/- 3.0 in M3, 9.7 
      +/- 1.7 in M4, and 8.9 +/- 1.2 mm in M6. Depth of bone available for patients
      with heights >/=165 cm versus <165 cm had means of 10.4 +/- 1.3 and 8.0 +/- 1.6
      mm (p < .01), respectively; but showed no significant differences between BMI
      (BMI <25 vs. >/=25) and bone availability (6.8 +/- 1.7 vs. 6.8 +/- 1.6, p = .07),
      or age (<55 years vs. >/=55 years) and bone availability (9.8 +/- 1.6 vs. 9.8 +/-
      1.6, p = .11). In our case, the patient received 6 cm length of scapular bone
      with four 4.1 x 14 mm endosteal implants, which upon osseointegration was able to
      receive a fixed dental prosthesis. Three years after the initial surgery, the
      patient has had no difficulty with his prosthesis. CONCLUSION: In females the
      most proximal portion of the scapula will predictably accommodate a dental
      implant, while males have multiple sites including the proximal, middle, and
      distal portions.

TI  - An evaluation of superhydrophilic surfaces of dental implants - a systematic
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 79
LID - 10.1186/s12903-019-0767-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The characteristics of a dental implant surface have a decisive
      influence on the process of osseointegration. According to the current state of
      knowledge, surface modification can not only affect the morphology of cells, and 
      in this way have a positive impact on osseointegration. METHODS: The objective of
      this study was to compare survival rates and marginal bone loss as well as assess
      the degree of stability of Straumann SLAactive(R) and Thomenn Incell(R) implants 
      with a superhydrophilic surface. Authors present review of data published between
      01.01.2008 and 12.31.2016 that was found in PubMed/MEDLINE internet database, An 
      Internet search of databases produced a total of 1230 studies, 20 publications
      were finally selected for the present study based on the established selection
      and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: The statistical analysis was performed. A
      Cumulative Implant Survival Rate (CSR%) was 98.5%, Marginal bone loss (MBL) after
      6 months was M = 0.60 mm and 0.6 5 mm after 12 months and secondary stability in 
      a group Thommen implants M = 71.3 ISQ and M = 75.2 ISQ in group of Straumann.
      CONCLUSION: Despite certain differences in the values of the studied parameters, 
      both of the systems, i.e. Thommen Inicell and Straumann SLActive, demonstrated a 
      high survival rate, a high level of implant stability and low marginal bone loss.

TI  - Influence of a Novel Surface of Bioactive Implants on Osseointegration: A
      Comparative and Histomorfometric Correlation and Implant Stability Study in
      Minipigs.
LID - E2307 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms20092307 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to assess the influence of a novel
      surface of dental implants (ContacTi((R))) on the osseointegration process in a
      minipig model. The surface was compared with other existing surfaces on the
      market (SLA((R)) and SLActive((R))) by employing bone implant contact analysis
      (BIC) and implant stability. METHOD: Twelve minipigs were used with prior
      authorisation from an ethics committee. Three types of surfaces were tested:
      SLA((R)) (sand-blasted acid-etched titanium), SLActive((R)) (same but
      hydrophilic, performed under a nitrogen atmosphere), and ContacTi((R)) (alumina
      particle bombardment of titanium, bioactivated when treated thermochemically) in 
      4.1 mm x 8 mm implants with internal connection and a polished neck. Twelve
      implants of each surface type (N = 36) were placed, sacrificing 1/3 of the
      animals at 2 weeks of placement, 1/3 at 4 weeks and the remaining 1/3 at 8 weeks.
      Numerical variables were compared with Analysis of Variance, and the correlation 
      between ISQ and BIC was established with the Spearman's rank correlation
      coefficient. RESULTS: SLActive((R)) and ContacTi((R)) surfaces showed elevated
      osteoconductivity at 4 weeks, maintaining a similar evolution at 8 weeks (large
      amount of mature lamellar tissue with high maturity and bone quality). The
      SLA((R)) surface showed slower maturation. The ISQ values in surgery were
      elevated (above 65), higher at necropsy and higher at 4 and 8 weeks in the
      SLA((R)) group than in the other two (SLActive((R)) and ContacTi((R))). No
      significant correlation was found between ISQ and BIC for each implant surface
      and necropsy time. CONCLUSION: The three surfaces analysed showed high RFA and
      BIC values, which were more favourable for the SLActive((R)) and ContacTi((R))
      surfaces. No statistical correlation was found between the RFA and BIC values in 
      any of the three surfaces analysed.

TI  - Combustion Synthesis Porous Nitinol for Biomedical Applications.
PG  - 4307461
LID - 10.1155/2019/4307461 [doi]
AB  - Porous Nitinol with a three-dimensional anisotropic interconnective open pore
      structure has been successfully produced by the combustion synthesis (CS) of
      elemental Ni and Ti powders. The resulting product can be tailored to closely
      match the stiffness of cancellous bone to minimize stress shielding. The average 
      elastic modulus was approximately 1 GPa for a porosity of 60 vol% and the average
      pore size of 100-500 microm. The low elastic modulus meets the basic demand for
      orthopedic bone ingrowth applications. Furthermore, porous Nitinol was composed
      of cubic (austenitic) and monoclinic (martensitic) NiTi compounds without the
      presence of Ni metal or Ni-rich phases. The resulting product exhibits excellent 
      corrosion resistance with breakdown potentials above 750mV. An ovine study in
      cortical sites of the tibia demonstrated rapid osseointegration into the porous
      strucutre as early as two weeks and complete bone growth across the implant at
      six weeks. A separate ovine study showed complete through-growth of bone at four 
      months using a lumbar interbody fusion model, substantiating the use of porous
      Nitinol as an implant material for applications in the spine. Porous Nitinol is
      thus a promising biomaterial with proven biocompatibility and exceptional
      osseointegration performance which may enhance the healing process and promote
      long-term fixation, making it a strong candidate for a wide range of orthopedic
      implant applications.

TI  - To Drill or to Densify? Clinical Indications for the Use of Osseodensification.
PG  - 276-281; quiz 282
AB  - As highlighted in part 1 of this two-part article, primary mechanical stability
      in implant dentistry is considered a prerequisite for successful
      osseointegration. While many surgical techniques have been conceptualized with
      the goal of improving implant stability, osseodensification (OD) represents a
      novel method utilizing the accumulation of autogenous bone within the implant
      site via the compaction of cancellous bone, which has good viscoelastic and
      plastic deformation characteristics. The philosophy of this technique runs
      counter to that of conventional bone drilling in that healthy bone is maintained 
      within the implant osteotomy, especially in regions where bone density is already
      compromised. This article focuses on the clinical indications of OD. Three cases 
      are presented and include a lateral sinus augmentation procedure, a crestal sinus
      augmentation in combination with use of a synthetic bone putty, and a
      socket-shield technique in the esthetic zone. The aim of this article is to
      provide clinicians a better understanding of OD and methods to optimize the
      technique. It also highlights favorable clinical outcomes in cases where initial 
      bone density has been compromised.

TI  - Periodic Assessment of Peri-implant Tissue Changes: Imperative for Implant
      Success.
PG  - 173-178
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the peri-implant hard
      and soft tissues and implant stability and to assess the correlation of bone loss
      and peri-implant probing depth with implant stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Twenty-one patients with implants were included in this study and implants were
      assessed by resonance frequency analysis (RFA). Bone levels of the implants were 
      assessed by measuring mesial and distal bone levels from the periapical
      radiograph, and soft tissue was assessed from probing depth using a periodontal
      probe. Implants were assessed for stability and probing depth at pre-loading, at 
      3 months and 6 months post-loading. RFA and probing depth were statistically
      compared from different time points. Correlation of probing depth and marginal
      bone loss with implant stability was also determined. RESULTS: The average change
      in implant stability quotient (ISQ) measurements from pre-loading to 6 months
      post-loading was found to be statistically significant (p <0.005). The average
      probing depth reduced from 1.767 mm at pre-loading to 1.671 mm at post-loading 3 
      months, and 1.600 mm at post-loading 6 months. At 6 months of function,
      radiographic examination yielded 0.786 mm mesial bone loss and 0.8 mm distal bone
      loss. It was found to be statistically significant (p <0.005) but within an
      acceptable range. No significant correlation was found between implant stability 
      and bone loss; and implant stability and probing depth. CONCLUSION: The study
      revealed an increasing trend in implant stability values with the time that
      indicates successful osseointegration. Increasing mean values for mesial and
      distal bone loss were also found. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The success of dental
      implants is highly dependent on the quality of bone and implant-bone interface,
      i.e., osseointegration. The most important factors that influence the survival
      rate of an implant is initial stability. The present study found the changes in
      the peri-implant hard and soft tissues and implant stability. This article, while
      being a prospective study, may show the evidence of successful osseointegration
      by increasing trend in implant stability (RFA) values with time which can help to
      the clinician in the long-term management of implants.

TI  - The impact of proton pump inhibitors on bone regeneration and implant
      osseointegration.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/03602532.2019.1610767 [doi]
AB  - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have become known for the treatment of gastric-acid
      related disorders. Similar to any other drugs, PPIs have possible adverse
      reactions, being associated with bone fractures, infections, kidney disease,
      mineral deficiency, dementia, and pneumonia. Multiple analyses have stated that
      PPIs therapy may affect bone regeneration and osseointegration process, causing
      an increased risk of bone fracture, deterioration of bone metabolism and impaired
      bone healing. In this review, we emphasized the current literature regarding the 
      influence of proton pump inhibitors in the bone regeneration process. Results
      from the studies suggest a link between PPIs intake and bone regeneration, but
      several concerns are raised regarding inadequate recipient bone, surgical trauma,
      limitations on the titanium surface, comorbidities or interference with other
      pharmacological agents. Further studies are needed to determine whether the
      impaired bone regeneration process is due to PPI or coexisting factors.

TI  - Regulation of osteoblast behaviors via cross-talk between Hippo/YAP and MAPK
      signaling pathway under fluoride exposure.
LID - 10.1007/s00109-019-01785-x [doi]
AB  - Titanium is widely used in implant materials, while excessive fluoride may have
      negative effects on the osseointegration between the titanium and osteoblasts.
      Although the underlying mechanisms are still not clear, the mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK) or Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathways are
      thought to be involved. This study evaluated the role of Hippo/YAP and MAPK
      signaling pathway in osteoblast behaviors under excessive fluoride exposure in
      vitro and in vivo. Commercially pure Ti (cp-Ti) samples were exposed to fluoride 
      (0, 0.1, and 1.0 mM NaF) for 7 days. Cell adhesion was observed using a laser
      scanning confocal microscope. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by
      CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expressions of osteoblast
      markers and key molecules in MAPK and YAP pathway were detected by Western blot. 
      In vivo studies were evaluated by histology methods in C57/BL6 mice model. Our
      results showed that 1.0 mM NaF destroyed the passivation film on cp-Ti surface,
      which further inhibited the osteoblast adhesion and spreading. Meanwhile,
      compared to other groups, 1.0 mM NaF led to a remarkable reduction in cell
      viability (P < 0.05), as well as increased apoptosis (P < 0.05) and
      downregulation of osteogenesis protein expression (P < 0.05). MAPK and YAP
      signaling pathways were also activated under 1.0 mM NaF exposure, and JNK seemed 
      to regulate YAP phosphorylation in response to NaF impacts on osteoblasts. In
      vivo fluorosis mouse model further indicated that 100 ppm NaF group (high
      fluoride group) increased bone resorption and inhibited the nuclear translocation
      of YAP. The osteoblast behaviors were negatively altered under excessive
      fluoride, and MAPK/JNK axis contributed to YAP signaling activation in regulating
      NaF-induced osteoblast behaviors. KEY MESSAGES: * Excessive fluoride inhibited
      osteoblast behaviors and bone formation. * YAP and MAPK signaling pathways were
      activated in osteoblasts under fluoride exposure. * Fluoride regulated osteoblast
      behaviors via the cross-talk between YAP and MAPK.

TI  - Incorporation of HA into porous titanium to form Ti-HA biocomposite foams.

AB  - Ti foams are advanced materials with great potential for biomedical applications 
      as they can promote bone ingrowth, cell migration and attachment through
      providing interconnected porous channels that allow the penetration of the
      bone-forming cells and provide them with anchorage sites. However, Ti is a
      bio-inert material and thus only mechanical integration is achieved between the
      porous implant and the surrounding tissue, not the chemical integration which
      would be desirable. In this work particles of a biologically active material
      (Hydroxyapatite, HA) are blended with titanium powder, and used to produce Ti
      foams through the use of Metal Injection Moulding (MIM) in combination with a
      space holder. This produces titanium foams with incorporated HA, potentially
      inducing more favourable bone response to an implant from the surrounding tissue 
      and improving the osseointegration of the Ti foams. To be able to do this,
      samples need to show sufficient mechanical and biocompatibility properties, and
      the foams produced were assessed for their mechanical behaviour and in vitro
      biological response. It was found that the incorporation of high levels of HA
      into the Ti foams induces brittleness in the structure and reduces the load
      bearing ability of the titanium foams as the chemical interaction between Ti and 
      HA results in weak ceramic phases. However, adding small amounts of HA (about
      2vol%) was found to increase the yield strength of the Ti foams by 61% from
      31.6MPa to 50.9MPa. Biological tests were also carried out in order to
      investigate the suitability of the foams for biomedical applications. It was
      found that Ti foams both with and without HA (at the 2vol% addition level)
      support calcium and collagen production and have a good level of
      biocompatibility, with no significant difference observed between samples with
      and without the HA addition.

AB  - The in vivo regeneration of bone flaps might be an alternative to autogenous bone
      grafting. The first human case of mandibular reconstruction using the greater
      omentum as a bioreactor was reported in 2016. However, whether engineered bone
      will support the osseointegration of dental implants has not yet been
      investigated. In this study, bone tissue engineering was performed in the greater
      omentum of nine miniature pigs using bone morphogenetic protein 2, bone marrow
      aspirate, and three different scaffolds: hydroxyapatite, biphasic calcium
      phosphate (BCP), and titanium. After 8 weeks, two implants were placed in each
      scaffold; after another 8 weeks, the bone blocks were harvested for radiographic,
      histological, and histomorphometric analysis. All implants exhibited sufficient
      primary stability, and the success rate was 100%. The bone-to-implant contact
      ratios (BICs) were 38.2%, 68.5%, and 42.9%; the inter-thread bone densities were 
      29.4%, 64.9%, and 33.5%; and the peri-implant bone-scaffold densities were 56.4%,
      87.6%, and 68.6% in the hydroxyapatite, BCP, and titanium groups, respectively.
      The BIC showed a strong correlation (r = 0.76) with the peri-implant
      bone-scaffold density. This study shows that de novo engineered bone leads to
      successful osseointegration and therefore may allow implant-based prosthodontic
      rehabilitation.

TI  - Sandblasting reduces dental implant failure rate but not marginal bone level
      loss: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e0216428
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0216428 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sandblasting is one of the oldest implant surface modifications to 
      enhance osseointegration. Regarding its superiority over machined surface
      controversies still exist. Our objective was to compare implant failures (IF) and
      marginal bone level (MBL) changes between sandblasted and machined dental
      implants by a meta-analysis utilizing the available data. The PROSPERO
      registration number of the meta-analysis is CRD42018084190. METHODS: The
      systematic search was performed in Cochrane, Embase and Pubmed. Inclusion
      criteria included participants with neither systemic diseases, nor excessive
      alcohol consumption, nor heavy smoking. We calculated pooled Risk Ratio (RRs)
      with confidence intervals of 95% (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes (implant failure)
      and weighted mean difference (WMD) CIs of 95% for continuous outcomes (marginal
      bone level change). We applied the random effect model with DerSimonian-Laird
      estimation. I2 and chi2 tests were used to quantify statistical heterogeneity and
      gain probability-values, respectively. RESULTS: Literature search revealed 130
      records without duplicates. Out of these, seven studies met the inclusion
      criteria and all were included in data synthesis, involving 362 sand-blasted and 
      360 machined implants. The results indicate that there is an 80% (RR = 0.2 95%
      CI:0.06-0.67; I2 = 0.0% p = 0.986) lower among sandblasted compared to machined
      implants after one year of use and 74% (RR = 0.26 95% CI:0.09-0.74; I2 = 0.0% p =
      0.968) five years of use, respectively. In contrast, there is no significant
      difference in MBL (WMD:-0.10mm, 95% CI:-0.20, 0.01; p>0.05; I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.560 
      and WMD:-0.01mm, 95% CI:-0.12, 0.09; p>0.05; I2 = 26.2%, p = 0.258) between the
      two implant surfaces after one and five years of use. CONCLUSIONS: This
      meta-analysis reveals that sandblasting is superior over machined surface in
      implant failure but not in marginal bone level in healthy subjects. It also
      points out the need for further randomized clinical trials with large sample size
      for objective determination of the clinical benefits of certain implant surface
      modifications.

TI  - Distribution of Trabecular Bone Density in the Maxilla and Mandible.
LID - 10.1097/ID.0000000000000893 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Implant osseointegration is strongly influenced by the bone quality
      at the implant insertion site. The present work aims to create distribution
      diagrams showing the average bone density at each position within the jaws.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from 4 oral surgeons
      who sought bone-density measurements during implant placement using a
      torque-measuring implant micromotor. Statistical analyses were performed to
      investigate whether bone density correlated with the patients' sex and age and
      whether the bone-density values at different positions within each arch
      correlated to each other. RESULTS: Records of 2408 patients and 6060 bone-density
      readings were retrieved, and density distribution diagrams were created. Density 
      values showed a significant variation within subjects. Within the same jaw,
      density between adjacent positions showed significant differences. Density at a
      given position correlated significantly with that at the other positions in most 
      cases. Bone density was significantly lower in women than in men; no significant 
      correlation was found between bone density and the patient age. CONCLUSIONS: Bone
      density of patients displays significant interindividual variation, thus
      meaningful assessment must be conducted on a patient-by-patient basis.

TI  - Visible-Light-Induced Photocatalytic and Antibacterial Activity of TiO2 Codoped
      with Nitrogen and Bismuth: New Perspectives to Control Implant-Biofilm-Related
      Diseases.
PG  - 18186-18202
LID - 10.1021/acsami.9b03311 [doi]
AB  - Biofilm-associated diseases are one of the main causes of implant failure.
      Currently, the development of implant surface treatment goes beyond the
      osseointegration process and focuses on the creation of surfaces with
      antimicrobial action and with the possibility to be re-activated (i.e., light
      source activation). Titanium dioxide (TiO2), an excellent photocatalyst used for 
      photocatalytic antibacterial applications, could be a great alternative, but its 
      efficiency is limited to the ultraviolet (UV) range of the electromagnetic
      spectrum. Since UV radiation has carcinogenic potential, we created a functional 
      TiO2 coating codoped with nitrogen and bismuth via the plasma electrolytic
      oxidation (PEO) of titanium to achieve an antibacterial effect under visible
      light with re-activation potential. A complex surface topography was demonstrated
      by scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional confocal laser scanning
      microscopy. Additionally, PEO-treated surfaces showed greater hydrophilicity and 
      albumin adsorption compared to control, untreated titanium. Bismuth incorporation
      shifted the band gap of TiO2 to the visible region and facilitated higher
      degradation of methyl orange (MO) in the dark, with a greater reduction in the
      concentration of MO after visible-light irradiation even after 72 h of aging.
      These results were consistent with the in vitro antibacterial effect, where
      samples with nitrogen and bismuth in their composition showed the greatest
      bacterial reduction after 24 h of dual-species biofilm formation ( Streptococcus 
      sanguinis and Actinomyces naeslundii) in darkness with a superior effect at 30
      min of visible-light irradiation. In addition, such a coating presents reusable
      photocatalytic potential and good biocompatibility by presenting a
      noncytotoxicity effect on human gingival fibroblast cells. Therefore, nitrogen
      and bismuth incorporation into TiO2 via PEO can be considered a promising
      alternative for dental implant application with antibacterial properties in
      darkness, with a stronger effect after visible-light application.

TI  - Tissue integration of zirconia and titanium implants with and without buccal
      dehiscence defects-A histologic and radiographic preclinical study.
LID - 10.1111/clr.13451 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To histologically and radiographically evaluate soft (primary outcome)
      and hard tissue integration of two-piece titanium and zirconia dental implants
      with/without buccal dehiscence defects. MATERIALS & METHODS: In six dogs, five
      implants were randomly placed on both sides of the mandible: (a) Z1: a zirconia
      implant (modified surface) within the bony housing, (b) Z2: a zirconia implant
      (standard surface) within the bony housing, (c) T: a titanium implant within the 
      bony housing, (d) Z1_D: a Z1 implant placed with a buccal bone dehiscence (3 mm
      in height, identical width to implant body), and (e) T_D: a titanium implant
      placed with a buccal bone dehiscence. Two weeks of healing and 6 months of
      loading were applied on each hemi-mandible, respectively. RESULTS: The median
      level of the margo mucosae shifted more apically over time in all groups
      (borderline statistical significance in groups Z1_D: -0.52 mm and T_D: -1.26 mm).
      The median height of the peri-implant mucosa in groups Z1_D and T_D was greatest 
      at 2 weeks and 6 months, but the linear change in the peri-implant mucosa was
      statistically significant only for group T_D over time (-1.45 mm). Z1
      demonstrated a higher bone-to-implant contact compared to Z2 and T. Minimal
      change of radiographic marginal bone levels in all groups was observed (<1 mm).
      CONCLUSION: When buccal dehiscence was presented, titanium implants presented
      significant loss of peri-implant mucosal height compared to zirconia implants
      with a modified surface, due to greater apical shift of the margo mucosae. A
      modified zirconia surface enhanced osseointegration.

TI  - Osseointegration effect of biomimetic intrafibrillarly mineralized collagen
      applied simultaneously with titanium implant: A pilot in vivo study.
LID - 10.1111/clr.13449 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the promoting effects of biomimetic intrafibrillarly
      mineralized collagen (IMC) bone scaffold material on the osseointegration of a
      titanium implant simultaneously grafted into a critical-sized bone defect as well
      as the underlying mechanisms involved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A critical-sized
      bone defect was created in the rat femur, and a titanium (Ti) implant surrounded 
      by IMC or extrafibrillarly mineralized collagen (EMC) bone scaffold material was 
      placed in the defect. A blank group and a natural bone group were included as
      controls. Osseointegration was assessed by micro-computed tomographic,
      histological, and biochemical evaluations at 12 weeks postoperatively. Microarray
      technology was applied for transcriptional profile analysis at days 7 and 14
      postoperatively. RESULTS: Significant bone regeneration and osseointegration were
      observed in the IMC and EMC groups according to mu-CT and histological analyses. 
      The bone volume (BV)/total volume (TV) fraction, bone-to-implant contact
      percentage, and bone area percentage as well as ultimate shear strength and
      maximal pull-out force were all significantly higher in the IMC group than in the
      EMC group (all p < 0.05). Transcriptional analysis revealed overexpression of
      genes mainly associated with cell proliferation, immuno-inflammatory response,
      skeletogenesis, angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and skeletogenesis-related pathways
      during the early process of osseointegration in the IMC group. CONCLUSION: Our
      data suggest that IMC placed simultaneously with a Ti implant may be a promising 
      strategy in jawbone defect reconstruction. Several candidate genes that were
      found to be differentially expressed in the IMC group may be responsible for the 
      superior osseointegration effects in this model.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential trends for the year 2030 in dental implant
      dentistry in Europe using the Delphi methodology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A
      steering committee and a management team of experts in implant dentistry were
      created and validated a questionnaire including 60 questions, divided in eight
      topics. The survey was conducted in two rounds using an anonymous questionnaire, 
      which provided the participants in the second round with the results of the
      first. Each question had three possible answers, and the results were expressed
      as percentages. RESULTS: A total of 138 experts were invited to participate in
      the survey. From all the invited experts, 52 answered in both the first and
      second rounds. Three different consensus categories were established based on the
      percentage of agreement: no consensus (<65%); moderate consensus (65%-85%); and
      high consensus (>/=86%). Within the topic categories, a consensus was reached
      (mainly moderate consensus) for the majority of questions discussed among experts
      during a face to face consensus meeting. However, consensus was not reached for a
      small number of questions/topics. CONCLUSIONS: About 82% of the questions reached
      consensus. The consensus points towards a lower number of implants to replace
      chewing units, with implants surfaces made of bioactive materials with reduced
      micro-roughness using mainly customized abutments with polished surfaces and an
      internal implant-abutment connection (85%). CBCT-3D technologies will be the main
      tool for pre-surgical implant placement diagnosis together with direct digital
      restorative workflows. There will be an increase in the incidence of
      peri-implantitis, although there will be more efficient interventions its
      treatment and prevention.

TI  - Surface Immobilization of TiO2 Nanotubes with Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2
      Synergistically Enhances Initial Preosteoblast Adhesion and Osseointegration.
PG  - 5697250
LID - 10.1155/2019/5697250 [doi]
AB  - Although titanium (Ti) alloys have been widely used as implant materials, the
      bioinertness of pristine Ti impairs their bioactivity and early osseointegration.
      In the present work, we prepared TiO2 nanotubes (TNT) layer on the titanium (Ti) 
      surface by anodic oxidation. The anodized surface was functionalized with human
      bone morphogenetic protein-2 coating to form the hBMP-2/TNT surface. The release 
      behavior of hBMP-2 on the hBMP-2/TNT surface displayed a controlled and sustained
      pattern, compared to that on the hBMP-2/Ti surface, which showed a rapid release.
      In vitro cellular activity tests demonstrated that both TNT and hBMP-2/Ti
      surfaces, particularly the hBMP-2/TNT surface, enhanced adhesion, proliferation, 
      and differentiation of osteoblast cells. Increased cell adhesion, improved
      cytoskeleton organization, and immunofluorescence staining of vinculin were
      observed on the modified surfaces. The TNT, hBMP-2/Ti, and hBMP-2/TNT surfaces,
      especially the hBMP-2/TNT surface, further displayed an upregulated gene
      expression of adhesion and osteogenic markers vinculin, collagen type 1,
      osteopontin, and osteocalcin, compared to the pristine Ti surface. In vivo
      experiments using a rat model demonstrated that the TNT and hBMP-2/Ti surfaces,
      in particular the hBMP-2/TNT surface, improved osseointegration and showed a
      superior bone bonding ability compared to Ti. Our study revealed a synergistic
      role played by TiO2 nanotubes nanotopography and hBMP-2 in promoting initial
      osteoblast adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and osseointegration, thus
      suggesting a promising method for better modifying the implant surface.

TI  - The influence of Cisplatin-based chemotherapy on the osseointegration of dental
      implants: An in vivo mechanical and histometrical study.
LID - 10.1111/clr.13445 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of Cisplatin on bone repair and mineralization
      around implants and on the mechanical properties of bone tissue. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Forty-three Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: Cisplatin
      (CIS, medication) and control (CTL, placebo solution), administered once a week
      for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, implants were installed in both tibiae metaphysis.
      After 30 and 60 days, the animals were sacrificed and their femurs and tibiae
      were removed. Femurs were subjected to mechanical tests and tibiae for removal
      torque, arrangement and distribution of collagen fibers, morphometrical analyses 
      (bone tissue in contact with the implant surface [BIC] and areal fraction between
      implant threads occupied by bone tissue [BAFO]) and scanning electron microscopy 
      to calcium and calcium/phosphorus analysis. Data were analyzed by ANOVA or
      MANOVA, and Tukey or Games-Howell post hoc tests, respectively (alpha = 0.05).
      RESULTS: The CTL specimens had significantly higher values (0.0001 </= p</=0.036)
      of strength (N), removal torque (N/cm(2) ), %BIC, and %BAFO than CIS specimens,
      being their best results at day 60. No significant differences were found among
      the groups regarding the values of deformation, percentage of calcium, and
      calcium/phosphorus ratio. In CIS groups, there was a reduction in the
      organization of collagen at the bone/implant interface, resulting in a trabecular
      bone with thin trabeculae and birefringent collagen and irregular arrangement.
      CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Cisplatin interfered negatively in the
      repair and mineralization around dental implants, as well as on the quality of
      the bone tissue, mainly in the period of 30 days after the implant placement.

AB  - Microbial infection around dental implants is a major cause for the loss of
      devices, including soft tissue infection in early period, post-operation
      peri-implantitis, and osseointegration failure. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with
      wide antimicrobial spectrum, strong antimicrobial effect and hypotoxicity, as
      well as low incidence of antibiotic resistance, are widely involved in biomedical
      applications. Herein, firmly anchoring AgNPs onto the surface of implants through
      physical-chemical reaction is likely to relieve the above issues. In this study, 
      AgNPs were biosynthesized by a simple and "green" method with chitosan (CS) as
      stabilizing and reducing agents. Then, AgNPs-loaded CS-heparin polyelectrolyte
      multilayers (PEMs) were constructed on alkali-heat treated titanium (Ti)
      substrates via layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly technique. The successful
      surface modification could be confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
      X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the constructed system could provide 
      the continuous release of Ag(+) over 28 days till mucosa healing. In short, this 
      work revealed that the construction of multilayer coatings containing AgNPs on Ti
      substrates promoted adhesion and proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts
      (HGFs) and also enhanced the antimicrobial properties. This manifests the LbL
      technique is a viable and promising method for forming continuous antimicrobial
      coatings, to reduce microbial infection and improve the quality of peri-implant
      soft tissue seal. The preparation process of AgNPs-loaded CS-heparin PEMs on Ti
      substrate.

TI  - Mechanically Strong Silica-Silk Fibroin Bioaerogel: A Hybrid Scaffold with
      Ordered Honeycomb Micromorphology and Multiscale Porosity for Bone Regeneration.
PG  - 17256-17269
LID - 10.1021/acsami.9b04283 [doi]
AB  - Due to the synergic feature of individual components in hybrid
      (nano)biomaterials, their application in regenerative medicine has drawn
      significant attention. Aiming to address all the current challenges of aerogel as
      a potent scaffold in bone tissue engineering application, we adopted a novel
      synthesis approach to synergistically improve the pore size regime and mechanical
      strength in the aerogel. The three-dimensional aerogel scaffold in this study has
      been synthesized through a versatile one-pot aqueous-based sol-gel
      hybridization/assembly of organosilane (tetraethyl orthosilicate) and silk
      fibroin (SF) biopolymer, followed by unidirectional freeze-casting of the
      as-prepared hybrid gel and supercritical drying. The developed ultralight
      silica-SF aerogel hybrids demonstrated a hierarchically organized porous
      structure with interesting honeycomb-shaped micromorphology and microstructural
      alignment (anisotropy) in varied length scales. The average macropore size of the
      hybrid aerogel lied in approximately 0.5-18 mum and was systematically controlled
      with freeze-casting conditions. Together with high porosity (91-94%), high
      Young's modulus ( approximately 4-7 MPa, >3 order of magnitude improvement
      compared to their pristine aerogel counterparts), and bone-type anisotropy in the
      mechanical compressive behavior, the silica-SF hybrid aerogel of this study acted
      as a very competent scaffold for bone tissue formation. The results of in vitro
      assessments revealed that the silica-SF aerogel is not only cytocompatible and
      nonhemolytic but also acted as an open porous microenvironment to trigger
      osteoblast cell attachment, growth, and proliferation on its surface within 14
      days of incubation. Moreover, to support the in vitro results, in vivo bone
      formation within the aerogel implant in the bone defect site was studied. The
      X-ray radiology and microcomputed tomography analyses confirmed that a
      significant new bone tissue density formed in the defect site within 25 days of
      implantation. Also, in vivo toxicology studies showed a zero-toxic impact of the 
      aerogel implant on the blood biochemical and hematological parameters. Finally,
      the study clearly shows the potential of aerogel as a bioactive and
      osteoconductive open porous cellular matrix for a successful osseointegration
      process.

TI  - Microgrooves and Microrugosities in Titanium Implant Surfaces: An In Vitro and In
      Vivo Evaluation.
LID - E1287 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma12081287 [doi]
AB  - The physical characteristics of an implant surface can determine and/or
      facilitate osseointegration processes. In this sense, a new implant surface with 
      microgrooves associated with plus double acid treatment to generate roughness was
      evaluated and compared in vitro and in vivo with a non-treated (smooth) and
      double acid surface treatment. Thirty disks and thirty-six conical implants
      manufactured from commercially pure titanium (grade IV) were prepared for this
      study. Three groups were determined, as described below: Group 1 (G1), where the 
      samples were only machined; group 2 (G2), where the samples were machined and had
      their surface treated to generate roughness; and test group 3 (G3), where the
      samples were machined with microgrooves and the surface was treated to generate
      the roughness. For the in vitro analysis, the samples were submitted to scanning 
      microscopy (SEM), surface profilometry, the atomic force microscope (MFA) and the
      surface energy test. For the in vivo analyses, thirty-six implants were placed in
      the tibia of 9 New Zealand rabbits in a randomized manner, after histological and
      histomorphometric analysis, to determine the level of contact between the bone
      and implant (BIC%) and the bone area fraction occupancy (BAFO%) inside of the
      threads. The data collected were statistically analyzed between groups (p <
      0.05). The in vitro evaluations showed different roughness patterns between the
      groups, and the G3 group had the highest values. In vivo evaluations of the BIC% 
      showed 50.45 +/- 9.57% for the G1 group, 55.32 +/- 10.31% for the G2 group and
      68.65 +/- 9.98% for the G3 group, with significant statistical difference between
      the groups (p < 0.0001). In the BAFO% values, the G1 group presented 54.97 +/-
      9.56%, the G2 group 59.09 +/- 10.13% and the G3 group 70.12 +/- 11.07%, with
      statistical difference between the groups (p < 0.001). The results obtained in
      the evaluations show that the surface with microgrooves stimulates the process of
      osseointegration, accelerating the healing process, increasing the contact
      between the bone and the implant and the area of new bone formation.

TI  - Biological responses of human bone mesenchymal stem cells to Ti and TiZr implant 
      materials.
LID - 10.1111/cid.12756 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Titanium-zirconium alloy (TiZr1317) is a new material used for
      biological implants. There are several studies on the effects of TiZr implants on
      the biological characteristics of human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs).
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological responses of
      hBMSCs to implant holes affected by the physicochemical properties of oral
      implants (TiSLA , TiSLActive , TiZrSLA , and TiZrSLActive ). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Grade 4 Ti and TiZr (13-17% Zr) substrates were modified by sand-blasted
      large-grit acid-etched (SLA) or hydrophilic sand-blasted large-grit acid-etched
      (SLActive), resulting in four types of surface with complex microstructures
      corresponding to the commercially-available implants SLA, RoxolidSLA, SLActive,
      and RoxolidSLActive (Institute Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland). Physicochemical
      properties were detected and the biological responses of hBMSCs were observed.
      RESULTS: Surface morphology characterization by scanning electron microscopy and 
      atomic force microscopy revealed differences between the four groups. SLActive
      had higher surface energy/wettability than SLA, indicating that increased surface
      energy/wettability can promote the absorption of osteogenic proteins and enhance 
      osseointegration. hBMSCs seeded on SLActive substrates exhibited better
      performance in terms of cell attachment, proliferation and osteoblastic
      differentiation than cells seeded on SLA. CONCLUSION: Because of their more
      suitable physicochemical properties, TiSLActive and TiZrSLActive materials
      demonstrated more pronounced effects on the biological responses of hBMSCs
      compared with TiSLA and TiZrSLA .

TI  - Two to six-year disease resolution and marginal bone stability rates of a
      modified resective-implantoplasty therapy in 32 peri-implantitis cases.
LID - 10.1111/cid.12773 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different nonsurgical, antibacterial, surgical, and regenerative
      approaches to treat peri-implantitis have been proposed, but there is no an
      actual "gold" standard treatment showing the most favorable results to counteract
      peri-implantitis effects. PURPOSE: To evaluate radiographically and clinically
      the disease resolution and peri-implant marginal bone stability rates of
      peri-implantitis cases treated through a combined resective-implantoplasty
      therapy in a moderate to long-term period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of
      patients diagnosed with peri-implantitis and treated through the same protocol
      applying a combined resective-implantoplasty therapy with minimum 2-year
      follow-up were screened. Eligible patients were contacted and asked to undergo
      clinical and radiologic examination. Progressive marginal bone loss, bleeding on 
      probing, suppuration, implant mobility, and implant fracture were considered to
      establish the disease resolution rate and peri-implant bone stability of the
      treated implants. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with 32 treated implants
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Over the 2 to 6-year follow-up, (mean time: 3.4
      +/- 1.5 years), the disease resolution rate was 83% (patient level) and 87%
      (implant level). Four implants (13%) were lost or removed due to continuous MBL
      and osseointegration failure. At follow-up, peri-implant marginal bone remained
      stable with no further bone loss in 87% of the treated implants. BOP was absent
      in 89.3% (implant level), suppuration was resolved in all cases, and no pain or
      implant fracture was reported. CONCLUSION: Implantoplasty treated cases showed
      high disease resolution rate and peri-implant marginal bone stability. This
      surgical antibiofilm strategy can counteract peri-implantitis progression
      providing an adequate environment for implant function and longevity over a
      moderate to long-term period.

AB  - Drilling is a common surgical procedure for fracture treatment and reconstruction
      in multiple surgical fields, including orthopaedics, neurology, and dentistry.
      Drilling delicate tissue (such as bone) with a hard metallic tool is considered
      notorious for inducing mechanical and thermal damage, which can adversely affect 
      osseointegration and may weaken the bond between the bone and implant, or other
      fixative devices anchoring the bone. The aim of this study is to explore the
      benefits of vibrational drilling (VD) in overcoming the complications associated 
      with conventional drilling (CD). Drilling tests were performed on fresh cortical 
      bone with the intention of investigating the effect of a range of frequencies, in
      combination with drilling speed and feed rate, on biological damage around the
      drilling region using histological sections of skeletally mature bone. The study 
      examined the most influential factors and optimal combination of parameters for
      safe and efficient drilling in bone. Results from Taguchi grey relational
      analysis showed that a lower drilling speed and feed rate combined with a
      frequency of 20kHz were favourable parameters for safe drilling in bone.
      Accordingly, VD using controlled parameters may be an alternative to CD in bone
      surgical procedures.

      Study.

AB  - We evaluated the shear bond strength of bone-implant contact, or
      osseointegration, in the rabbit tibia model, and compared the strength between
      grades 2 and 4 of commercially pure titanium (cp-Ti). A total of 13 grades 2 and 
      4 cp-Ti implants were used, which had an identical cylinder shape and surface
      topography. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron
      spectroscopy, and confocal laser microscopy were used for surface analysis. Four 
      grades 2 and 4 cp-Ti implants were inserted into the rabbit tibiae with complete 
      randomization. After six weeks of healing, the experimental animals were
      sacrificed and the implants were removed en bloc with the surrounding bone. The
      bone-implant interfaces were three-dimensionally imaged with micro-computed
      tomography. Using these images, the bone-implant contact area was measured.
      Counterclockwise rotation force was applied to the implants for the measurement
      of removal torque values. Shear bond strength was calculated from the measured
      bone-implant contact and removal torque data. The t-tests were used to compare
      the outcome measures between the groups, and statistical significance was
      evaluated at the 0.05 level. Surface analysis showed that grades 2 and 4 cp-Ti
      implants have similar topographic features. We found no significant difference in
      the three-dimensional bone-implant contact area between these two implants.
      However, grade 2 cp-Ti implants had a higher shear bond strength than grade 4
      cp-Ti implants (p = 0.032). The surfaces of the grade 2 cp-Ti implants were
      similar to those of the grade 4 implants in terms of physical characteristics and
      the quantitative amount of attachment to the bone, whereas the grade 2 surfaces
      were stronger than the grade 4 surfaces in the bone-surface interaction,
      indicating osseointegration quality.

TI  - Grip control and motor coordination with implanted and surface electrodes while
      grasping with an osseointegrated prosthetic hand.
PG  - 49
LID - 10.1186/s12984-019-0511-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Replacement of a lost limb by an artificial substitute is not yet
      ideal. Resolution and coordination of motor control approximating that of a
      biological limb could dramatically improve the functionality of prosthetic
      devices, and thus reduce the gap towards a suitable limb replacement. METHODS: In
      this study, we investigated the control resolution and coordination exhibited by 
      subjects with transhumeral amputation who were implanted with epimysial
      electrodes and an osseointegrated interface that provides bidirectional
      communication in addition to skeletal attachment (e-OPRA Implant System). We
      assessed control resolution and coordination in the context of routine and
      delicate grasping using the Pick and Lift and the Virtual Eggs Tests. Performance
      when utilizing implanted electrodes was compared with the standard-of-care
      technology for myoelectric prostheses, namely surface electrodes. RESULTS:
      Results showed that implanted electrodes provide superior controllability over
      the prosthetic terminal device compared to conventional surface electrodes.
      Significant improvements were found in the control of the grip force and its
      reliability during object transfer. However, these improvements failed to
      increase motor coordination, and surprisingly decreased the temporal correlation 
      between grip and load forces observed with surface electrodes. We found that
      despite being more functional and reliable, prosthetic control via implanted
      electrodes still depended highly on visual feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
      indicate that incidental sensory feedback (visual, auditory, and osseoperceptive 
      in this case) is insufficient for restoring natural grasp behavior in amputees,
      and support the idea that supplemental tactile sensory feedback is needed to
      learn and maintain the motor tasks internal model, which could ultimately restore
      natural grasp behavior in subjects using prosthetic hands.

TI  - Radiographic Evaluation of Bone Remodeling Around Osseointegration Implants Among
      Transfemoral Amputees.
LID - 10.1097/BOT.0000000000001488 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine periprosthetic bone remodeling among the recipients of two
      types of lower-limb osseointegrated systems, the Integral Leg Prosthesis (ILP)
      and the Osseointegration Prosthetic Limb Type-A (OPL), over a > 24-month period. 
      DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Private hospital, with a specialized
      osseointegration unit. PATIENTS: Twenty-eight patients with transfemoral lower
      limb amputations were fitted with osseointegrated systems. Of these patients, 15 
      received the ILP and 13 the OPL osseointegrated implant. INTERVENTION:
      Radiographic measurements were taken at baseline (0.4 +/- 0.5 years) and at
      follow-up (3.0 +/- 0.8 years) following the osseointegration procedure. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Radiographic bone density, longitudinal bone coverage, and 
      bone width outcomes were measured in inverse 'Gruen Zones'. Bone remodeling was
      evaluated by comparing changes between baseline and follow-up measurements.
      RESULTS: Radiographic bone density decreased in all zones among both ILP and OPL 
      groups. Cortical bone thickness increased among the OPL group in Zones 3 (p <
      0.05) and 5 (p < 0.05). Distal bone coverage of the ILP implant decreased by 2.3%
      (p < 0.01 ) and 4.1% (p < 0.05) of the total implant length on the medial and
      lateral sides respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased bone density with increased
      periprosthetic cortical thickness suggests a change in the bone architecture for 
      the OPL group. The findings of this study raise concerns for the long-term
      success of the ILP implant. Radiographic analysis of X-rays appears to be a
      useful tool for clinicians to evaluate bone remodeling around osseointegrated
      prosthesis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II.

TI  - Comparative in vivo study of alloy titanium implants with two different surfaces:
      biomechanical and SEM analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s00784-019-02872-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical behavior 
      of the interface formed between bone and implants with machined surfaces (MS) and
      those modified by Al2O3 sandblasting and acid etching (SBAS). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Before surgery, topographic characterization was performed by SEM-EDX
      and by mean roughness measurements. Ten Albinus rabbits received randomly 20
      Ti-6Al-4V implants on its right and left tibiae, with one implant placed in each 
      tibia. After implant insertion, the implant stability quotient (ISQ) was measured
      by means of resonance frequency analysis (RFA). After 3 and 6 weeks, the ISQ was 
      again measured, followed by torque removal measurements. Analysis of variance and
      Tukey tests were used to analyze the data. The surface of the implants removed
      was evaluated by SEM-EDX. Immunohistochemical analysis of osteopontin (OPN) and
      osteocalcin (OC) protein was performed in bone tissue. RESULTS: The topographic
      characterization showed differences between the analyzed surfaces, and the mean
      roughness values of SBAS group were statistically higher than MS. Overall, higher
      statistically significant ISQ values were observed in the SBAS group compared to 
      the MS group (p = 0.012). The intra-group comparison of ISQ values in the SBAS
      group showed statistically significant differences between 0 and 3 weeks (p =
      0.032) and 0 and 6 weeks (p = 0.003). The torque removal measurements of group
      SBAS were statistically higher when compared with the torque removal measurements
      of group MS in the time intervals of 3 weeks (p = 0.002) and 6 weeks (p < 0.001).
      SEM-EDX of the implant surfaces removed in SBAS group showed greater bone tissue 
      covering and mean values atomic in percentage of Ca, P, and O statistically
      superior (p < 0.05) than MS group. Immunohistochemical reactions showed intense
      OC immunolabeling at 6 weeks postoperative for SBAS group. CONCLUSIONS: The
      topographical modifications made in group SBAS allowed a better mechanical
      interlocking between the implant and bone tissue.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of bone substitute materials on hard and soft
      tissue healing in reconstructive surgical therapy of experimental
      peri-implantitis at implants with different surface characteristics. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Six female, Labrador dogs were used. 3 months after tooth extraction,
      four implants with two different surface characteristics (A and B) were installed
      on each side of the mandible. Experimental peri-implantitis was induced 3 months 
      later. During surgical treatment of peri-implantitis, the implants were cleaned
      with curettes and cotton pellets soaked in saline. The implant sites were
      allocated to one of four treatment categories; (a) Group C; no augmentation, (b) 
      Group T1; bone defect filled with deproteinized bovine bone mineral (c) Group T2;
      bone defect filled with a biphasic bone graft material, (d) Group T3; bone defect
      filled as T1 and covered with a collagen membrane. Clinical and radiological
      examinations were performed, and biopsies were obtained and prepared for
      histological analysis 6 months after peri-implantitis surgery. RESULTS: Implant B
      (smooth surface) sites showed significantly (a) larger radiographic bone level
      gain, (b) enhanced resolution of peri-implantitis lesions, and (c) larger
      frequency of re-osseointegration than implant A (moderately rough surface) sites.
      Implant B sites also showed superior preservation of the mucosal margin.
      Differences between bone substitute materials and control procedures were overall
      small with limited advantages for T1 and T2 sites. CONCLUSION: Healing following 
      reconstructive surgical treatment of experimental peri-implantitis was superior
      around implants with a smooth surface than implants with a moderately rough
      surface. Benefits of using bone substitute materials during surgical therapy were
      overall small.

TI  - Evaluation of The Bio-Stimulatory Effect of Platelet Rich Fibrin Augmented by
      Diode LASER Compared to Platelet Rich Fibrin Alone on Dental Implant Replacing
      Posterior Mandibular Teeth. Randomised Clinical Trial: Split Mouth Study.
PG  - 869-875
LID - 10.3889/oamjms.2019.183 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restoring masticatory function and replacing missing teeth with
      minimal pain and discomfort are the most important issues for the patient and
      clinician. Nowadays dental implants became the most popular line of treatment to 
      replace missing teeth; offering a comfortable long lasting prosthesis.
      Osseo-integration reflects the long term success of a dental implant. Many
      bio-modulators are used aiming to improve the osseointegration and healing around
      dental implants such as Low-Level Laser treatment (LLLT) and Platelet Rich Fibrin
      (PRF). PRF has been proven to improve bone repair process around the dental
      implant. LLLT is considered a noninvasive, safe technique that stimulates
      osteogenesis and alleviates post-operative pain. AIM: Evaluation of the
      bio-stimulatory effect of LLLT on a dental implant with PRF compared to PRF alone
      clinically and radiographically. METHODS: A randomised clinical trial with the
      split-mouth design was conducted on nine patients with bilaterally missing lower 
      posterior tooth. All patients received one dental implant on each side with PRF. 
      LASER application was performed to one side twice weekly for one month starting
      on the day of insertion. Post-operative pain was assessed daily through the first
      week using numerical rating pain scale (NRS) as the primary outcome. Relative
      peri-implant bone density was measured using direct digital intraoral radiography
      immediately after insertion, one, four and nine months postoperatively. Implants 
      stability were measured using radio frequency assessment immediately after
      insertion, four and nine months post-operative as secondary outcomes. RESULTS:
      The NRS for pain was significantly decreased by the end of the first-week
      postoperatively in the intervention and control group with a mean of (2.22 +/-
      1.56) (2.11 +/- 1.83) respectively. However, there was no statistically
      significant difference between the test groups at P-Value (0.892). The relative
      bone density values were decreased by the end of the ninth month of follow-up in 
      the intervention and control group with a mean of (134.42 +/- 16.13) (128.77 +/- 
      33.54) respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed between
      the two test groups at P-value (0.863). The radiofrequency values for implant
      stability showed no statically significant difference after nine months of follow
      up when compared to the initial stability values at the day of insertion in the
      intervention and control group. The mean radiofrequency values were (67.24 +/-
      1.79) and (66.9 +/- 2.57) respectively, and no statistically significant
      difference was observed between the two test groups at P-value (0.793).
      CONCLUSION: There are no statistically significant differences in post-operative 
      pain values, implant stability and bone density between the implant sites treated
      with PRF augmented by Diode laser compared to implant sites treated by PRF alone.

AB  - Objective: To discuss the feasibility and effectiveness of using micro-CT in
      bone-implant contact (BIC) evaluation in dogs, and to provide reference for
      clinical and scientific research. Methods: Bilateral mandibular second premolar
      and first molar of six male Beagle dogs were extracted. After 3 months' healing, 
      eight implants were placed in bilateral mandible of each dog, four on each side. 
      Dogs were sacrificed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after implant placement, two
      on each time point. Samples were scanned with micro-CT and digitally
      reconstructed. Bone-implant interface was analyzed at different analysis regions 
      (25, 50 and 100 mum from implants' surface), different detection range models
      were obtained (each time point consists 48 models), and BIC was evaluated, and
      the results were counted as micro-CT(25), micro-CT(50), and micro-CT(100) groups.
      Then undecalcified slides were made (three slides for each sample) and stained
      with toluidine blue for observation and analysis of BIC using an optical
      microscope, and the results were counted as optical microscope groups. The
      advantages and disadvantages, evaluation efficiency and BIC of different methods 
      were analyzed. Results: To evaluate BIC of single sample, it took about 90
      minutes by micro-CT, which was much lower than the time of 14 days by optical
      microscope. The success rates of modeling of micro-CT(25), micro-CT(50), and
      micro-CT(100) groups all were 100.0% (48/48), and total success rate of micro-CT 
      group was 100.0% (144/144). For optical microscope groups, the success rates of
      making slides 2, 4, 8 weeks were 89.6% (43/48), 93.8% (45/48) and 93.8% (45/48), 
      respectively, and total success rates of optical microscope group was 92.4%
      (133/144). At 2, 4,8 weeks after implantation, BIC in micro-CT(25) group was
      significantly smaller than that in optical microscope group at the same time
      point (P<0.05). However, at 2, 4,8 weeks after implantation, BIC of the
      micro-CT(50) and micro-CT(100) groups showed no significant difference with
      optical microscope groups at the same time point (P>0.05). A significant
      correlation (P<0.001, each) was seen between slides and micro-CT (25, 50, 100 mum
      groups) concerning BIC (r=0.680, r=0.892, r=0.713), and error bias was -19.4%,
      -0.9%, 3.0%, respectively. The probability within the 95% limits of agreement
      were 97.9%. Conclusions: Micro-CT is a faster, simpler and more efficient way to 
      analyze BIC at the implant-bone interface than optical microscope observation.
      BIC analysis by selecting 50 mum from implants' surface as analysis region using 
      micro-CT is in consistent with that using the optical microscope.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine behavior and function of osteoblasts
      on saliva-contaminated titanium and its potential improvement after UV light
      treatment. Acid-etched titanium disks were contaminated with human saliva.
      Osteoblasts derived from rat femur were cultured on contaminated and clean
      titanium disks. Contaminated disks further treated with UV light were also
      tested. The number of attached cells, the degree of cell spreading, and the
      expression of adhesion protein were significantly decreased on
      saliva-contaminated surfaces compared with clean surfaces. The gene expression of
      osteocalcin was also downregulated on contaminated surfaces, whereas ALP activity
      and mineralization were not significantly influenced. The impaired functions on
      contaminated surfaces were significantly increased if the surfaces were further
      treated with UV and even outperformed the ones on clean titanium surfaces. XPS
      analysis revealed that the atomic percentage of carbon and nitrogen detected on
      contaminated surfaces were substantially decreased after UV treatment. These
      results suggest that osteoblastic behavior and function were compromised on
      titanium surfaces contaminated with saliva. The compromised functions no longer
      happened if the surfaces were further treated with UV light, providing the basis 
      to understand the effect of biological contamination on osseointegration and to
      explore UV treatment as a decontaminating technology.

TI  - Osseodensification: An Overview of Scientific Rationale and Biological
      Background.
PG  - 217-222; quiz 223
AB  - In implant dentistry, primary mechanical stability is considered a prerequisite
      for successful osseointegration. That is, the alveolar bone architecture of the
      implant drilling site is critical in dictating the success rate of the implant.
      Immediately after implant placement, a series of cellular and molecular events
      occur directly on the implant surface (apposition), whereby host tissues
      biologically integrate the "foreign" biomaterial into the native bone structure. 
      While cortical bone is responsible for providing the function of withstanding
      torsional loading and enabling high initial implant stability, cancellous bone is
      richer in cellular content and is vasculature and, therefore, capable of
      supplying progenitor cells more rapidly to the implant surface. This article
      provides an overview of the basic biological remodeling events that take place
      following implant placement and outlines surgical methods used over the years to 
      increase primary implant stability. Thereafter, implant loading protocols
      utilizing low, high, and excessive torque are discussed. Finally, the authors
      introduce the biological rationale supporting the concept of osseodensification
      of osteotomy sites, which have been heavily utilized in modern implant dentistry.

TI  - Influence of the Elastic Modulus on the Osseointegration of Dental Implants.
LID - E980 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma12060980 [doi]
AB  - The load transfer from metallic prosthesis to tissue plays an important role in
      the success of a designed device. From a mechanical behavior point of view, the
      load transfer will be favored when the elastic modulus between the metallic
      implant and the bone tissue are similar. Titanium and Ti-6Al-4V are the most
      commonly used metals and alloys in the field of dental implants, although they
      present high elastic moduli and hence trigger bone resorption. We propose the use
      of low-modulus beta-type titanium alloys that can improve the growth of new bone 
      surrounding the implant. We designed dental implants with identical morphology
      and micro-roughness composed of: Ti-15Zr, Ti-19.1Nb-8.8Zr, Ti-41.2Nb-6.1Zr, and
      Ti-25Hf-25Ta. The commercially pure Ti cp and Ti-6Al-4V were used as control
      samples. The alloys were initially mechanically characterized with a tensile test
      using a universal testing machine. The results showed the lowest elastic modulus 
      for the Ti-25Hf-25Ta alloy. We implanted a total of six implants in the mandible 
      (3) and maxilla (3) for each titanium alloy in six minipigs and evaluated their
      bone index contact (i.e., the percentage of new bone in contact with the
      metal-BIC%) after 3 and 6 weeks of implantation. The results showed higher BIC%
      for the dental implants with lowest elastic modulus, showing the importance of
      decreasing the elastic modulus of alloys for the successful osseointegration of
      dental implants.

TI  - Scoping Review of the Role of Shared Decision Making in Dental Implant
      Consultations.
PG  - 130-140
LID - 10.1177/2380084418761340 [doi]
AB  - To what extent does dental research on implant consultations focus on the use of 
      shared decision making? There has been an explosion in the use of implant
      therapies in dentistry, but very little is known about the decision-making
      processes involved in the provision of dental implants. The use of shared
      decision making (SDM) has been found to reduce undesirable outcomes and increase 
      patient and clinician satisfaction in other health care fields. This scoping
      review reports on the current status of SDM in research on implant therapies. A
      scoping review methodology was used. Web of Knowledge, MEDLINE via OvidSP,
      MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, DARE, and CINAHL databases were
      reviewed between 1900 and December 1, 2017. The search strategy resulted in 2,289
      eligible articles; 1,892 duplicated articles were deleted, resulting in a hand
      search of 397 titles and abstracts. These were subsequently evaluated while
      applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in 48 articles for
      full-text evaluation. After full-text evaluation of these 48 studies, a further
      27 were eliminated as not being relevant, leading to the inclusion of 21 studies 
      for the review. No studies to date have examined how patients and dentists engage
      in decisions to place dental implants. Aspects that were discussed in the
      literature related to the decision-making process included a discussion about
      patients' values and discussing possible treatment options. How patients and
      dentists interacted during implant consultations was poorly explored. Shared
      decision making has been shown to improve health care quality and increase
      clinician and patient satisfaction. Further research concerning dental implant
      decisions is warranted with emphasis on evaluating patients' contributions to
      treatment, which is currently poorly understood. Exploring existed methods for
      examining the SDM process in implant consultations should facilitate improve care
      and consent. Knowledge Transfer Statement: The findings of this scoping review
      can be used by all dentists when deciding which decision-making model they wish
      to use when planning implant therapy. The article places special emphasis on the 
      role of shared decision making in improving health care quality and increasing
      patients' and clinicians' satisfaction.

AB  - In this study, microgroove patterns and nanotubes with various parameter settings
      were hierarchically prepared on the titanium (Ti) surface, aiming to study the
      optimal hierarchical micro/nano pattern design for the neck and body surface of
      Ti dental implants. The adhesion and proliferation of MG63 osteoblasts, L929
      fibroblasts, SCC epithelial cells and P. gingivalis on these Ti substrates were
      investigated to evaluate their performance in osseointegration, gingival
      epithelial sealing and antibacterial ability. Using a novel scoring method based 
      on the cell or bacteria viability results, we found that 10 mum width and 2 mum
      depth groove pattern decorating with 55 nm diameter nanotubes was the best choice
      for the design of implant neck surface. Moreover, 20 mum width and 3.6 mum depth 
      groove pattern decorating with 55 nm nanotubes was suitable for the implant body 
      design. Our study systematically evaluated and screened the effects of different 
      hierarchical micro/nano patterns on the growth of implant-healing related cells
      and bacteria. It preliminarily proved that it is feasible to reduce the incidence
      of peri-implantitis through the optimal hierarchical design of implants, which
      has great value in implant surface design and promoting the application of dental
      implants in clinical.

TI  - Fabrication of dental implants by the additive manufacturing method: A systematic
      review.
LID - S0022-3913(19)30096-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.prosdent.2019.01.018 [doi]
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Placement of dental implants depends, among other factors, 
      on anatomic conditions such as sufficient bone height and thickness. Thus,
      individualized dental implants seem to offer benefits for patients with alveolar 
      bone resorption. Additive manufacturing has allowed for the fabrication of custom
      implants with microscale resolution and, although the efficiency of the process
      is unclear, is a potential process for manufacturing dental implants. PURPOSE:
      The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the current situation of
      additive manufacturing techniques for fabricating dental implants. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: An electronic search was performed in the databases PubMed, Lilacs,
      Cochrane Library, and Science Direct, with the terms "additive manufacturing" AND
      "dental implants," "rapid prototyping" AND "dental implants," "3 D printing" AND 
      "dental implants," "electron beam melting" AND "dental implants," "selective
      laser melting" AND "dental implants." The articles were screened, and the final
      selection of articles was obtained by using the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      RESULTS: The database search resulted in 1322 articles, which were screened for
      title and/or summary according to the inclusion criteria. From the selected 38
      articles, 30 remained after applying the exclusion criteria. These were read
      completely, resulting in a selection of 13 articles for this systematic review.
      Owing to the great variety of articles with different objectives, the results
      were based on a descriptive analysis of the following topics: additive
      manufacturing technique and material, printed structure and implant design,
      implant characteristics, mechanical analysis, surface treatment, and
      osseointegration. CONCLUSIONS: Additive manufacturing is a new technology that
      may solve many problems in diverse fields. In dentistry, however, further studies
      are needed to improve the method for manufacturing custom dental implants because
      no standard methodology is available. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages 
      of the process are not yet clearly defined.

TI  - Mechanical and Biological Advantages of a Tri-Oval Implant Design.
LID - E427 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm8040427 [doi]
AB  - Of all geometric shapes, a tri-oval one may be the strongest because of its
      capacity to bear large loads with neither rotation nor deformation. Here, we
      modified the external shape of a dental implant from circular to tri-oval, aiming
      to create a combination of high strain and low strain peri-implant environment
      that would ensure both primary implant stability and rapid osseointegration,
      respectively. Using in vivo mouse models, we tested the effects of this geometric
      alteration on implant survival and osseointegration over time. The maxima regions
      of tri-oval implants provided superior primary stability without increasing
      insertion torque. The minima regions of tri-oval implants presented low
      compressive strain and significantly less osteocyte apoptosis, which led to
      minimal bone resorption compared to the round implants. The rate of new bone
      accrual was also faster around the tri-oval implants. We further subjected both
      round and tri-oval implants to occlusal loading immediately after placement. In
      contrast to the round implants that exhibited a significant dip in stability that
      eventually led to their failure, the tri-oval implants maintained their stability
      throughout the osseointegration period. Collectively, these multiscale
      biomechanical analyses demonstrated the superior in vivo performance of the
      tri-oval implant design.

AB  - Aims and Objective: Chemically modified and sandblasted acid-etched (SAE)
      mechanism leads to wettability of surfaces of dental implants which helps in
      osseointegration. The present study was conducted to determine the implant
      stability quotient (ISQ) of SAE and SAE chemically modified dental implants.
      Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted on 210 patients with 120
      males and 90 females. Dental implants (Adin) with SAE (Group A) and SAE
      chemically modified (Group B) were inserted in patients. RFA was done immediately
      after implant insertion and after 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 14
      weeks. Results were statistically evaluated using SPSS Statistics for Windows,
      Version 21.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA. Results: Maximum patients were in the
      age group of 25-35 years (males - 65, females - 48), followed by 35-45 years
      (males - 40, females - 32) and 45-55 years (males - 15, females - 10). Maximum
      dental implants were given in the right side (88) in males than females (56). On 
      the left side, maximum implants were given in females (62) than males (56).
      Maximum RFA value of 86.2 and minimum value of 44.6 were observed in SAE dental
      implants (A). The maximum mean RFA value in chemically modified implants SAE (B) 
      was 89.4 and minimum was 32.5. Conclusion: It was observed that surface treatment
      of dental implants shows higher implant-bone osseointegration. There is fastest
      osseointegration in implants with hydrophilic surfaces than those with SAE
      surfaces. ISQ was higher than 75 in both groups, which indicate higher implant
      stability.

TI  - Socket Shield: A Case Report.
PG  - S72-S75
LID - 10.4103/jpbs.JPBS_228_18 [doi]
AB  - It is fairly common to remove a severely compromised tooth and provide
      rehabilitation by means of an implant. Resorption of alveolar bone after
      extraction resulting in loss of bone height and width is an unpleasant sequelae
      causing difficulty in implant placement. Few procedures have been promoted to
      attain the required bone height and width, such as guided bone regeneration
      socket preservation with the use of various graft materials and barrier
      membranes. The disadvantages of these techniques are some amount of ridge height 
      loss and loss of buccal/facial, ridge contour. The socket shield technique is a
      new method where a buccal segment of root is retained as a shield, which aids in 
      retaining periodontal ligament on buccofacial aspect. The implant is placed
      (immediate placement) lingual to this shield. This maintains the alveolar ridge
      height and buccofacial contour, thus providing superior aesthetics. This case
      report shows placement of an implant in upper anterior region using this
      technique.

AB  - Two type of partially stabilized zirconia, namely yttria-stabilized tetragonal
      zirconia polycrystals (Y-TZP) and ceria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia
      polycrystals including aluminum oxide nanocomposite (Ce-TZP), were irradiated by 
      nanosecond-pulsed Nd:YAG laser and the regular structure with concave and convex 
      of each 30 mum width and 30 mum depth were prepared on both surfaces. In the case
      of Ce-TZP, the surface was changed to be black after laser irradiation. EDX
      measurement revealed the reduction of more amounts of oxygen atoms on Ce-TZP
      compared to Y-TZP. Laser irradiated zirconia implants were inserted into the bone
      defects of rat femur during 4 weeks. As a control, large grid sandblasted and
      acid etching (blastedHF) implant was used. Laser treatment for Y-TZP provided
      greater degree of bone-implant contact ratio than blastedHF treated Y-TZP
      (p<0.05). In the case of Ce-TZP, however, laser treatment showed no clear effect 
      on bone response.

TI  - Zirconia compared to titanium dental implants in preclinical studies-A systematic
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 365-395
LID - 10.1111/clr.13425 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether zirconia implants demonstrate differences in hard
      and soft tissue integration compared to titanium implants in preclinical studies.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: In March 2017, electronic (MEDLINE, EMBASE) and hand search
      was performed to identify preclinical studies comparing zirconia and titanium
      implants. Primary outcomes were bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and removal torque 
      out (RTQ), respectively, push-in (PI) measurements. Secondary outcomes included
      biologic width (BW) dimensions. RESULTS: A total of 37 studies were included for 
      data extraction after screening of 91 from 1,231 selected titles. Thirty-seven
      experimental studies using six different species were identified. The follow-up
      periods ranged between 0.4 and 56 weeks. For titanium, mean values of 59.1% (95% 
      CI: 53.3 - 64.8), 102.6 Ncm (95% CI: 81.5 - 123.6), and 25.1 N (95% CI: 20.2 -
      30.0) for BIC, RTQ, and PI were estimated, respectively. The mean values for
      zirconia were 55.9% (95% CI: 51.6 - 60.1), 71.5 Ncm (95% CI: 51.1 - 91.9), and
      22.0 N (95% CI: 13.2 - 30.7) for corresponding parameters. Confounding factors
      such as animal species, implant material, loading protocol, and study or loading 
      duration significantly influenced the outcomes. Similar qualitative soft tissue
      integration was reported for zirconia and titanium implants. However, faster
      maturation processes of epithelial and connective tissues around zirconia
      implants were assumed. Quantitatively, similar BW dimensions were evaluated for
      titanium (3.5 mm; 95% CI: 2.9 - 4.2) and zirconia (3.2 mm; 95% CI: 2.7 - 3.7),
      whereas the loading protocol significantly influenced the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Zirconia and titanium implants demonstrate a similar soft and hard tissue
      integration capacity. However, titanium tended to show a faster initial
      osseointegration process compared to zirconia. Importantly, not only material
      characteristics but predominantly animal species and study protocols can
      significantly influence the outcomes.

AB  - Superelastic titanium alloys (titanium-niobium-zirconium and
      titanium-niobium-tantalum) are considered to be the more advantageous choice for 
      dental implants than titanium alloys due to their physico-mechanical properties
      close to those of the bone tissue. Morphological studies of the biocompatibility 
      of these alloys in comparison with titanium were carried out in vivo. Scanning
      electron microscopy and microprobe elemental analysis of the tissue along the
      interface between the bone and titanium/superelastic titanium alloys showed
      similar morphology and elemental composition both on days 30 (poorly mineralized 
      connective tissue was detected in sites of contact with titanium alloy samples)
      and 90 after surgery (the surface of the titanium alloy samples was covered with 
      mineralized tissue similar by its composition to the surrounding bone).

TI  - The effect of plasma treatment on the osseointegration of rough titanium implant:
      A histo-morphometric study in rabbits.
PG  - 267-273
LID - 10.1016/j.jds.2018.06.002 [doi]
AB  - Abstract Background/purpose: The surface properties, such as hydrophilicity and
      functional OH groups, play an important role in bone fixation in vivo. In our
      previous study, the plasma treatments of large grit and acid etching (SLA) method
      produce functional OH groups on the rough surface. There is no report in
      discussing the integration between basic Ti-OH groups and bone-to-implant contact
      (BIC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the functional OH
      groups on the rough surface both in vitro and in vivo. Materials and methods:
      Functional hydroxyl groups were produced on a SLA-treated surface. The surface
      topography, roughness, wettability, and chemical composition were examined using 
      various techniques. Twenty-four implants were inserted into the proximal tibia of
      four New Zealand white rabbits. The biological responses were measured in terms
      of histomorphometric analysis 4 and 8 weeks post-implantation. Results: The
      surface morphology and roughness were similar among all groups. However, the
      concentration of OH groups and hydrophilicity were found increased in the plasma 
      treatment. The cell morphology in RF-plasma treated groups had more polygonal
      type and higher expression of actin and vinculin. The bone-to-implant contact
      (BIC) ratios of RF-200W were significantly higher than other groups (P<0.05). The
      relationship between basic OH groups and BIC showed linear correspondence.
      Conclusion: The Ti-OH groups introduced on the rough surface by plasma treatments
      can trigger cell adhesion which further initiate new bone apposition. We propose 
      that RF-plasma treatment can help to enhance bone healing at 4 and 8 weeks.

TI  - Nerve electrical stimulation enhances osseointegration of implants in the beagle.
PG  - 4916
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-41471-z [doi]
AB  - Dental implantation has been the primary method for the treatment of tooth loss, 
      but longer than 3 months healing times are generally required. Because immediate 
      load implants are suitable only for certain categories of implant patients, it
      has value to develop a novel method to facilitate the implant-bone
      osseointegration process. Cylindrical titanium implants were implanted in the
      tooth sockets of beagles, and microelectrode stimulation of the sympathetic
      nerves in the infraorbital nerve was performed after implantation for 1 week. The
      authors found that one-sided nerve stimulation was shown to evoke consistent
      electric potential changes in both sides of the infraorbital nerves. Moreover,
      after 4 weeks of implantation, more new bone was clearly observed around the
      implants in the beagles that received electrical stimulation treatment than was
      observed in the control animals. Furthermore, a higher mineralization density was
      measured in the new peri-implant bone tissues of the stimulated beagles when
      compared to controls. These results demonstrate that the simple and safe physical
      method of microelectrode stimulation to sympathetic nerves can promote the
      formation of new bone and the osseointegration of implants. This technique is
      worth promoting and has the potential to reduce the healing time of dental
      implantation in future clinical cases.

TI  - Research on implants and osseointegration.
PG  - 178-189
LID - 10.1111/prd.12254 [doi]
AB  - Osseointegration was originally defined as a direct structural and functional
      connection between ordered living bone and the surface of a load-carrying
      implant. It is now said that an implant is regarded as osseointegrated when there
      is no progressive relative movement between the implant and the bone with which
      it is in direct contact. Although the term osseointegration was initially used
      with reference to titanium metallic implants, the concept is currently applied to
      all biomaterials that have the ability to osseointegrate. Biomaterials are
      closely related to the mechanism of osseointegration; these materials are
      designed to be implanted or incorporated into the living system with the aims to 
      substitute for, or regenerate, tissues and tissue functions. Objective evaluation
      of the properties of the different biomaterials and of the factors that influence
      bone repair in general, and at the bone tissue-implant interface, is essential to
      the clinical success of an implant. The Biomaterials Laboratory of the Oral
      Pathology Department of the School of Dentistry at the University of Buenos Aires
      is devoted to the study and research of the properties and biological effects of 
      biomaterials for dental implants and bone substitutes. This paper summarizes the 
      research work resulting from over 25 years' experience in this field. It includes
      studies conducted at our laboratory on the local and systemic factors affecting
      the peri-implant bone healing process, using experimental models developed by our
      research team. The results of our research on corrosion, focusing on dental
      implants, as well as our experience in the evaluation of failed dental implants
      and bone biopsies obtained following maxillary sinus floor augmentation with bone
      substitutes, are also reported. Research on biomaterials and their interaction

      to achieve optimal biocompatibility and thus contribute to patient health.

AB  - The aim of the present review was to describe the studies produced in Latin
      America that contributed to the elucidation of the effect of tooth extraction
      with and without immediate implant installation. An electronic search was
      conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Scielo, Lilacs, and Embase to include
      clinical and experimental (animal) studies on immediate implants. The studies
      selected had to fulfill the following inclusion criteria: (i) to present clinical
      and/or histological data on socket healing with or without immediate implant
      installation; (ii) to be approved by a Latin American Ethic Committee or
      comparable; and (iii) to include at least one author from a Latin American
      institution or to be conducted in a Latin America institution. Latin American
      studies that fulfilled these criteria demonstrated that immediate implant
      installation was conducive for predictable osseointegration and high survival
      rates but failed to prevent bone modeling and dimensional reduction of the
      alveolar ridge. In addition, it was also shown that regenerative approaches,
      including hard and soft tissue grafts at the time of immediate implant placement,
      may be beneficial to compensate for the alveolar ridge reduction. Regenerative
      approaches immediately after tooth extraction may decrease the amount of
      dimension reduction of the alveolar ridge.

TI  - Electromyographic Connectivity of Masseter Muscle with Different Retentive
      Attachments for Implant Overdentures in Patients with Atrophied Mandibular
      Ridges: A Crossover Study.
LID - 10.11607/jomi.7484 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this crossover study was to evaluate electromyographic (EMG) 
      connectivity of masseter muscle with different attachments used to retain implant
      overdentures in patients with atrophied mandibular ridges. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Twenty-four edentulous participants with atrophic mandibular ridges received
      conventional dentures (control). Three months after the adaptation period, two
      implants were placed in the canine areas of the mandible. After osseointegration,
      each participant was successively given the following prostheses in a crossover
      manner: (1) ball-retained overdentures, (2) bar-retained overdentures, and (3)
      -retained overdentures. The EMG parameters (amplitude, chewing area, chewing
      rate, duration of chewing cycle, duration of chewing burst, and chewing time)
      were measured 3 months after wearing the following prostheses: conventional
      dentures, ball overdentures, bar overdentures, and Locator overdentures.
      Measurements were made during chewing of hard (carrot) and soft (cake) foods.
      RESULTS: The highest EMG activity/amplitude, chewing area, duration of chewing
      cycle, and duration of chewing burst were noted with ball overdentures, followed 
      by bar overdentures and Locator overdentures, and the lowest values were observed
      with conventional dentures. The highest chewing rate and masticatory time were
      noted with conventional dentures and the lowest values were observed with ball
      overdentures. With the exception of chewing area, no significant differences in
      all tested parameters between bar overdentures and Locator overdentures were
      observed. Except for duration of chewing cycle, all tested parameters were
      significantly higher during chewing of hard food than soft food. CONCLUSION:
      Within the limitations of this study, two-implant overdentures recorded higher
      muscle functions compared to conventional dentures regardless of the type of
      attachment used. For such overdentures, ball attachment may be recommended over
      bar and Locator attachments, as it was associated with improved muscle activity
      and function.

TI  - A Clinical Resonance Frequency Analysis of Implants Placed at Dehiscence-type
      Defects with Simultaneous Guided Bone Regeneration During Early Healing.
PG  - 772-777
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6834 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the implant stability quotient (ISQ) values of implants
      placed in bone with and without dehiscence bone defects over 12 weeks and to
      compare the ISQ values between the two groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two 
      patients with edentulous area at posterior mandible were enrolled. Thirty
      OsseoSpeed EV Astra Tech implants (Dentsply Sirona), 4.2 mm in diameter, were
      placed. Twenty implants were placed without bone regeneration (control group),
      while 10 presented with favorable bone defects and received simultaneous guided
      bone regeneration with dental implant placement (study group). At the time of
      implant placement, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, resonance frequency analysis (RFA) was 
      utilized. The changes in ISQ values within group were analyzed with
      repeated-measures ANOVA, and the mean ISQ values between the control and study
      groups were compared using unpaired t tests. RESULTS: All implants were
      successfully integrated without complication. The control group demonstrated mean
      ISQ values of 74.30 +/- 6.01, 69.58 +/- 5.30, 71.10 +/- 5.80, 75.08 +/- 3.93, and
      77.85 +/- 3.18 at baseline, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, respectively. The study group 
      demonstrated mean ISQ values of 69.85 +/- 7.00, 63.40 +/- 8.47, 59.90 +/- 10.23, 
      72.55 +/- 3.10, and 76.20 +/- 2.68 at baseline, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks,
      respectively. The study group showed significantly lower mean ISQ values at 2
      weeks (P = .021) and at 4 weeks (P = .007) after implant placement compared to
      those of the control group. CONCLUSION: Within the 12-week healing period, all
      implants demonstrated successful osseointegration and achieved stability in
      favorable bone defects. Nevertheless, clinicians should consider that
      significantly lower implant stability can occur in the first month.

TI  - Cell Phone Radiation Effect on Bone-to-Implant Osseointegration: A Preliminary
      Histologic Evaluation in Rabbits.
PG  - 643-650
LID - 10.11607/jomi.7024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The increased use of cell phones has raised many
      questions as to whether their use is safe for patients with dental implants. This
      study aimed to assess the consequences of cell phone-emitted radiation on
      bone-to-implant osseointegration during the healing phase. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Twelve rabbits were grouped into three groups of four. Group 1 (control) was not 
      exposed to electromagnetic radiation; group 2 (test) was exposed for 8 hours/day 
      in speech mode and 16 hours/day in standby mode; and group 3 (test) was exposed
      for 24 hours continuously in standby mode for 3 months. Forty-eight implants were
      placed in tibia and femur bone of rabbits, and after 90 days the rabbits were
      sacrificed and bone surrounding the implant was retrieved. Histopathologic
      evaluations of the specimens were done using transmitted light microscope. The
      differences among the three groups were statistically analyzed with analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) and pairwise comparisons via Fisher's exact test. RESULTS:
      Significantly less bone-to-implant contact and bone area surrounding implant
      threads were found in the test groups compared to the control group. There was a 
      significant difference in regular bone formation (P < .001) among the three
      groups. CONCLUSION: Implants exposed to cell phone radiation showed more
      inflammatory reaction when compared to the nonexposed implants, thus indicating
      that cellular phone overuse could affect the maturation of bone and thus delay
      osseointegration.

TI  - Use of Patient-Specific Finite Element Models in Dental Rehabilitation to
      Investigate Stresses of a Fibula Free Flap for Mandibular Reconstruction.
PG  - e21-e31
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6608 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigated the effect of implant length, diameter, and
      surface contact on the stresses developed in a fibular free flap. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Finite element (FE) models for dental implants placed in a
      patient-specific fibula were created using a patient-specific fibula CT scan and 
      geometry files of commercially available dental implants. The FE models involved 
      nine dental implants of different lengths and diameters: 3.5, 4.3, and 5.0 mm in 
      diameter and 10.0, 11.5, and 13.0 mm in length. Three contact conditions between 
      the implant and the fibular flap were investigated: complete fusion, friction,
      and smooth contact, representing complete osseointegration, a rough implant-bone 
      interface, and no osseointegration, respectively. Finite element analysis was
      performed to examine the average von Mises stresses around the local
      implant-fibula interface within the fibula under a load of 500 N along the long
      axis of the implant and posterior-anterior and lateral-medial directions.
      RESULTS: Both the level of osseointegration and implant size had noticeable
      effects on the mechanical stress inside the fibula. The stress introduced to the 
      fibula gradually decreased as the implant osseointegrated into the bone. An
      optimal implant size existed where the internal stresses were minimized; this
      trend was seen when investigating both the implant diameter and length. In this
      study, an implant with a diameter of 4.3 mm and length of 10 mm produced the
      lowest mechanical stresses overall. CONCLUSION: Both implant length and diameter 
      were influential; stresses were seen to decrease to a minimum then subsequently
      increase as either dimension increased. Additionally, stresses in bone introduced
      by an implant decreased as the degree of interaction between the implant and
      fibula increased. Complete fusion between the implant and bone yielded the lowest
      stresses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The recently developed bioactive glass PC-XG3, which is suitable to
      coat zirconia implant surfaces with high adhesion strength may reduce the time of
      osseointegration and the marginal bone loss following implantation. The glass
      composition has been previously evaluated for cytotoxicity on fibroblast cells,
      and will now be used to evaluate the cell behavior of osteoblast cells. METHODS: 
      Three different surface morphologies were created with PC-XG3 on zirconia discs. 
      A clinically tested zirconia implant surface as well as polished and machined
      zirconia served as a reference. Cell viability after 24 h, cell spreading after
      30 min and 24 h and the respective morphology of human osteoblasts using scanning
      electron microscopy were evaluated. Additionally, the corrosive process of PC-XG3
      in cell culture medium up to 7 d was measured. RESULTS: Initial cell behavior of 
      human osteoblasts was not accelerated by the PC-XG3 surface when compared to
      zirconia. Additionally, it was found that a decreased surface roughness promoted 
      initial cell spreading. Storage in cell culture medium resulted in the
      accumulation of C and N on the bioglass surface while Mg, Si, K and Ca were
      decreased and crack formation was observed. SIGNIFICANCE: Since initial spreading
      quality to a biomaterial is a crucial factor that will determine the subsequent
      cell function, proliferation, differentiation, and viability it can be assumed
      that a coating of zirconia implants with this bioactive glass will unlikely
      reduce osseointegration time.

AB  - Surface chemistry and topography can determinatively affect the osseointegration 
      of dental implants. Strontium (Sr) has a significant effect on the promotion of
      bone formation and inhibitation of bone resorption. The emphasis of this study
      lies on the evaluation of a new surface treatment that aims to improve the early 
      osseointegration of dental implantation both in vitro and in vivo. A hydrothermal
      method was used to prepare an SrTiO3 incorporation on sandblasted large-grit
      double acid-etched (SLA) titanium surfaces in SrCl2 solution. The composition and
      morphology of the SrTiO3 doped surface were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, X-ray 
      photoelectron spectroscopyand scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the
      external release figure of Sr was examined by inductively coupled plasma mass
      spectrometry. The proliferation, adhesion and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells
      on this surface were evaluated in vitro and presented a significant increase in
      SLA-Sr group compared with that in SLA group. An in vivo study in 24 New Zealand 
      rabbits indicated a remarkable growth in the volume of direct bone-to-implant
      contact and peri-implant bone in SLA-Sr group, which were compared with SLA group
      after 3 and 6weeks, and removal torque tests exhibited a higher torque removal
      value of SLA-Sr implants. The study gave the result that the biological effect of
      SLA-Sr implants was significantly superior to that of the SLA implants at the
      early stage of osseointegration.

AB  - Titanium and its alloys due to their low density, good mechanical and biological 
      properties are of the most common orthopedic metals. One of the main challenges
      regarding to titanium implants is their loosening after long term implantation in
      patient's body. Many methods such as alteration in surface topography with focus 
      on improving osseointegration or biocompatibility in overall are supposed to
      overcome this issue. In this research, titanium surface topography is altered via
      electrospraying a solution of titanium salt, carrier polymer
      (polyvinylpyrrolidone) and solvents. The dip coated samples in the same solution 
      are prepared and investigated as control. The electrosprayed or dip coated
      samples were pyrolysised in furnace at 500 degrees C to remove polymeric
      components. Then the stabilized microstructures on the surfaces were evaluated
      via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water contact angle (WCA) measurement,
      X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscope (AFM). Also, in order to
      study the bioactivity of modified samples, they were immersed in simulated body
      fluid (SBF) and their precipitates were studied. The cellular investigations were
      done by studying the cell morphology, MTT and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity
      assays. The results showed improvement in bioactivity and cellular response for
      DP3 and SP15 more than other samples implying the promising potential of these
      two approaches for titanium implant surface modification.

LID - 10.1111/prd.12245 [doi]
AB  - This volume of Periodontology 2000, entitled "Treatment Trends in Periodontics", 
      evaluates the importance of nonsurgical periodontal therapy and defines its role 
      as the key etiologic treatment of the disease. The need for scaling and root
      planing is mandatory step during the initial phase of therapy, as is self-care by
      the patient. Only after reevaluation of the outcome achieved by nonsurgical
      procedures should surgery be considered, and the concept of "critical probing
      depth" is emphasized. The chapters in this volume discuss different aspects of
      periodontal surgery, including regeneration and plastic periodontal procedures,
      and, looking toward the future, cell therapy in periodontics is explored. The
      impact of periodontal therapy on systemic diseases is reviewed, and the role of
      occlusion in periodontal disease is revisited and discussed. Topics on implants
      include their placement in fresh extraction sockets, socket healing with or
      without implant placement, and research on osseointegration. The important topic 
      of maintenance care of teeth and implants for long-term therapeutic success is
      thoroughly evaluated, as is the efficacy of dentifrices in oral hygiene. The
      editors convey a nutshell review of the concepts of what periodontal treatment
      should entail, based on scientific evidence generated during half-a-century of
      work in periodontics.

AB  - Zirconia implants are becoming a preference choice for different applications
      such as knee, dental, among others. In order to improve osseointegration,
      implant's surfaces are usually coated with bioactive materials like
      hydroxyapatite (HAp) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) that are very
      similar to the calcium phosphates found in bones. However, due to the
      implantation process, these coatings can be detached from the zirconia surface,
      leading to implant premature failure. In this work, a new component materials
      design aiming to avoid this coating detachment problem is proposed. It is based
      on the use of a bioactive zirconia-calcium phosphate composite outer layer onto
      the zirconia bulk, where the zirconia bulk provides mechanical strength and the
      outer layer provides biological performance. In order to assess the potential of 
      this new materials design, two types of bioactive zirconia outer composite layers
      (zirconia reinforced by 10vol% of HAp and by 10vol% of beta-TCP) were produced by
      press and sinter process and the gradated samples were fully characterized
      concerning materials, mechanical resistance, fatigue resistance, and biological
      performance, as measured by different approaches. Results showed that the novel
      component materials design and the manufacturing process proposed for producing
      the bioactive zirconia samples with outer composite layers on zirconia bulk
      substrates are a promising solution for implants, with improved biological
      performance without substantially compromising their overall mechanical and
      fatigue properties.

TI  - Impaired osseointegration of dental implants associated with orthognathic
      surgery: Possible regional acceleratory phenomenon.
LID - 10.1111/cid.12745 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regional acceleratory phenomenon (RAP) is demonstrated to decrease
      regional bone mineral density and accelerate bone turnover. Hypothesizing that
      RAP can negatively affect the osseointegration of biomaterials, this study aimed 
      to investigate the possible influence of the RAP on dental implant
      osseointegration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Orthognathic surgery, one of the major
      surgeries on oral and maxillofacial region was set as intervention for RAP.
      Considering that RAP exerts its physiologic effects until 4 months after noxious 
      stimuli, patients were classified according to the time interval between
      orthognathic surgery and dental implant installation; group I was designated to
      patients who had implant installation within 4 months from orthognathic surgery. 
      Group II were those with installation after 4-12 months and group III was longer 
      than 12 months. Radiographic and clinical evaluations of dental implants
      including peri-implant marginal bone changes (MBR), implant stability, cumulative
      survival rates were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients with 106 implants
      (mean follow-up of 72.6 months) were included in the study. MBR was significantly
      higher in group I (2.62 +/- 0.91 mm) and II (2.25 +/- 0.95 mm) compared to that
      of group III (0.94 +/- 0.90 mm) at last follow up (P < 0.05) and this group
      difference over time was also significant (P < 0.001). Compared to group III,
      groups I and II exhibited lower ISQ values and higher biological complications
      including peri-implantitis and peri-implant gingivitis (P < 0.05). Group I showed
      significantly low-cumulative survival rate (89.2%; implant-level) compared to
      groups II and III. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, impaired osseointegration of
      dental implants was demonstrated associated with orthognathic surgery.
      Micro-environmental changes of hard tissue induced by major surgery on the jaw
      showed deteriorating effects on integrity of biomaterial osseointegration.
      Special considerations should be addressed for ideal treatment results and
      prognosis.

TI  - The Role of MicroRNAs in the Osseointegration Process.
PG  - 397-410
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6581 [doi]
AB  - Regulation of cellular function is key to bone formation at endosseous implant
      surfaces. Osseointegration was "discovered" prior to the discovery of genetic
      regulation of osteoinduction or characterization of mesenchymal stem cells.
      Understanding osseointegration in cellular and molecular terms has benefited from
      genome-wide characterization of this healing process at endosseous implants in
      vivo. These in vivo studies also demonstrate a role for osteoprogenitor cells and
      cells involved in immune regulation and osteoclastogenesis. The identification of
      noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs, as key factors controlling cell function has
      highlighted the role of microRNAs in cell differentiation control. This review
      summarizes emerging in vitro and in vivo investigations emphasizing the role of
      microRNAs in the osseointegration process. Many microRNAs influence key
      osteoinductive pathways controlling Osterix, runt-related transcription factor 2 
      (RUNX2), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD function. Others influence the
      monocyte/macrophage lineage. While significant progress has been made in
      elucidating the mechanisms associated with the regulation of surface modulation
      of osteoblast differentiation by microRNAs, knowledge gaps are evident in the
      identification and characterization of microRNAs linked to osseointegration.
      Given existing knowledge regarding the varied expression of microRNAs and their
      role in inflammation, it is important to understand how microRNA expression may
      influence the process of bone accrual at implant surfaces during
      osseointegration.

      enhancement of antibacterial properties and osteoinductivity.
PG  - 1849-1863
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S190954 [doi]
AB  - Background: Despite titanium (Ti) implants have been commonly used in the medical
      device field due to their superior biocompatibility, implant-associated bacterial
      infection remains a major clinical complication. Nanosilver, an effective
      antibacterial agent against a wide spectrum of bacterial strains, with a
      low-resistance potential, has attracted much interest too. Incorporation of
      nanosilver on Ti implants may be a promising approach to prevent biofilm
      formation. Purpose: The objective of the study was to investigate the
      antibacterial effects and osteoinductive properties of nanosilver/poly
      (dl-lactic-co-glycolic acid)-coated titanium (NSPTi). Methods: Gram-positive
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the Gram-negative
      opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO-1) were used to evaluate the
      antibacterial activity of NSPTi implants through the analysis of bacterial
      colonization in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we examined the osteoinductive
      potential of NSPTi implants by investigating the proliferation and
      differentiation of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells. In vivo, the osteoinductive
      properties of NSPTi implants were assessed by radiographic evaluation, H&E
      staining, and Masson's trichrome staining. Results: In vitro, bacterial adhesion 
      to the 2% NSPTi was significantly inhibited and <1% of adhered bacteria survived 
      after 24 hours. In vitro, the average colony-forming units (CFU)/g ratios in the 
      2% NSPTi with 10(3) CFU MRSA and PAO-1 were 1.50+/-0.68 and 1.75+/-0.6,
      respectively. In the uncoated Ti groups, the ratios were 1.03+/-0.82x10(3) and
      0.94+/-0.49x10(3), respectively. These results demonstrated that NSPTi implants
      had prominent antibacterial properties. Proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells on the 2%
      NSPTi sample was 1.51, 1.78, and 2.22 times that on the uncoated Ti control after
      3, 5, and 7 days' incubation, respectively. Furthermore, NSPTi implants promoted 
      the maturation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. In vivo, NSPTi accelerated 
      the formation of new bone while suppressing bacterial survival. Conclusion: NSPTi
      implants have simultaneous antibacterial and osteoinductive activities and
      therefore have the potential in clinical applications.

TI  - Biomechanical and Histological Analysis of Titanium (Machined and Treated
      Surface) Versus Zirconia Implant Materials: An In Vivo Animal Study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to perform an in vivo histological
      comparative evaluation of bone formation around titanium (machined and treated
      surface) and zirconia implants. For the present study were used 50 commercially
      pure titanium implants grade IV, being that 25 implants with a machined surface
      (TiM group), 25 implants with a treated surface (TiT group) and, 25 implants were
      manufactured in pure zirconia (Zr group). The implants (n = 20 per group) were
      installed in the tibia of 10 rabbits. The implants distribution was randomized (n
      = 3 implants per tibia). Five implants of each group were analyzed by scanning
      electron microscopy and an optical laser profilometer for surface roughness
      characterization. Six weeks after the implantation, 10 implants for each group
      were removed in counter-torque for analysis of maximum torque value. The
      remaining samples were processed, included in historesin and cut to obtain
      non-decalcified slides for histomorphological analyses and histomorphometric
      measurement of the percentage of bone-implant contact (BIC%). Comparisons were
      made between the groups using a 5% level of significance (p < 0.05) to assess
      statistical differences. The results of removal torque values (mean +/- standard 
      deviation) showed for the TiM group 15.9 +/- 4.18 N cm, for TiT group 27.9 +/-
      5.15 N cm and for Zr group 11.5 +/- 2.92 N cm, with significant statistical
      difference between the groups (p < 0.0001). However, the BIC% presented similar
      values for all groups (35.4 +/- 4.54 for TiM group, 37.8 +/- 4.84 for TiT group
      and 34.0 +/- 6.82 for Zr group), with no statistical differences (p = 0.2171).
      Within the limitations of the present study, the findings suggest that the
      quality of the new bone tissue formed around the titanium implants present a
      superior density (maturation) in comparison to the zirconia implants.

AB  - Replacement of failing and ailing natural teeth with dental implants has become a
      mainstream treatment option since the discovery of osseointegration by P.-I.
      Branemark in the 1960s. The techniques and the variety of methods for alveolar
      bone reconstruction have evolved to address a restoratively driven approach in
      implant dentistry. Modern 3D cone-bean computed tomography has helped with the
      diagnosis and treatment of bone deficiencies to idealize implant positioning.
      This article focuses on bone augmentation techniques, classified into horizontal 
      and vertical ridge augmentation, and discusses block grafting, guided bone
      regeneration particulate grafting, distraction osteogenesis, and ridge-split
      expansion procedures.

      study in Yucatan mini pigs.
PG  - 44-54
LID - 10.1111/cid.12754 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A newly developed dental implant system combining advancements in
      surface chemistry, topography, nanostructure, color, and surface energy aims to
      address biological challenges and expand clinical applications. PURPOSE: To
      assess the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of a novel, gradually
      anodized dental implant surface/anodized abutment. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Twenty-four Yucatan mini pigs (20-24 months old) received two dental implants in 
      each jaw quadrant. Each site was randomized to receive either a commercially
      available anodized implant/machined abutment or a gradually anodized
      implant/anodized abutment with a protective layer. Animals were euthanized at 3, 
      6, and 13 weeks. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses were
      performed. RESULTS: No significant histological differences in inflammation
      scores, epithelium length, bone-to-implant contact, or bone density were observed
      between groups for any healing time. Mucosal height was significantly higher at 3
      weeks for controls (Delta = 0.2 mm); no differences were observed at 6 and 13
      weeks. No significant differences in radiographic bone volume, bone-to-implant
      contact, trabecular thickness, and crestal bone levels were observed,
      irrespective of healing time. Trabecular spacing was borderline significant at 3 
      weeks in favor of the test implant sites; no differences were observed at 6
      weeks. No significant differences were observed between experimental groups at 13
      weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The new implant system yielded results comparable to a
      commercially available predicate device.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of a novel anodized abutment on soft tissue healing in
      Yucatan mini-pigs.
PG  - 34-43
LID - 10.1111/cid.12755 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well established that electrochemical anodization of implant
      surfaces contributes to osseointegration and long-term implant survival. Few
      studies have investigated its effect on soft tissue healing. PURPOSE: To evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of a novel abutment surface prepared by electrochemical
      oxidation compared to commercially available machined titanium abutments.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve 16-19 months-old, Yucatan mini-pigs received three 
      dental implants in each mandibular jaw quadrant. Each side was randomized to
      receive either an anodized or a machined titanium abutment. Titanium healing caps
      were placed on both abutments. Animals were euthanized at 6 and 13 weeks.
      Radiographic and histological analyses were performed. RESULTS: No significant
      differences were observed histologically between groups in regard to
      inflammation, epithelium length, mucosal height, bone-to-implant contact, or bone
      density for any time point. Radiographically, crestal bone level change from
      baseline to 6 weeks was significantly lower for anodized than machined abutments 
      (P = 0.046); no significant differences were observed at 13 weeks (P = 0.12).
      CONCLUSIONS: The novel anodized abutment showed a comparable effect on soft and
      hard tissue healing/remodeling and inflammation reaction to standard titanium
      abutments. Clinical studies should confirm these findings and explore the
      positive radiographic results observed at the early time point.

TI  - Loads on Transhumeral Amputees Using Osseointegrated Prostheses.
PG  - 1369-1377

AB  - The treatment of the upper extremities is not as prevalent as that of the lower
      limbs, but it is nonetheless equally important. Today, there are no load data
      relating to upper extremity bone-anchored prosthesis users in the literature, but
      they are important in order to improve the rehabilitation protocol, design
      aspects and confidence of the user when it comes to loading the prosthesis in
      daily life. The aim of the present study was to investigate, in a population of
      eleven transhumeral amputees with osseointegrated implants, the load levels
      reached during specific prosthetic movements at maximum voluntary effort and
      during daily activities. The data showed a wide range of maximum load levels
      throughout the different activities. Furthermore, the data indicate that some
      test subjects felt apprehensive about loading the prosthesis, resulting in
      relatively low loads compared with the group as a whole. Within the limits of the
      present study, it was concluded that loading the implant system was subject
      specific, which resulted in large subject-to-subject variability. Moreover, some 
      subjects exhibited uncertainty about the levels that could damage the fixation or
      the implant system. The study illustrates the diversity and uncertainty that
      exist in a population of transhumeral amputees treated with bone-anchored
      prostheses in terms of loading in daily life.

TI  - In Situ Controlled Surface Microstructure of 3D Printed Ti Alloy to Promote Its
      Osteointegration.
LID - E815 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma12050815 [doi]
AB  - It is well known that three-dimensional (3D) printing is an emerging technology
      used to produce customized implants and surface characteristics of implants,
      strongly deciding their osseointegration ability. In this study, Ti alloy
      microspheres were printed under selected rational printing parameters in order to
      tailor the surface micro-characteristics of the printed implants during additive 
      manufacturing by an in situ, controlled way. The laser path and hatching space
      were responsible for the appearance of the stripy structure (S), while the
      bulbous structure (B) and bulbous(-)stripy composite surface (BS) were determined
      by contour scanning. A nano-sized structure could be superposed by hydrothermal
      treatment. The cytocompatibility was evaluated by culturing Mouse
      calvaria-derived preosteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1). The results showed that three 
      typical microstructured surfaces, S, B, and BS, could be achieved by varying the 
      3D printing parameters. Moreover, the osteogenic differentiation potential of the
      S, B, and BS surfaces could be significantly enhanced, and the addition of
      nano-sized structures could be further improved. The BS surface with nano-sized
      structure demonstrated the optimum osteogenic differentiation potential. The
      present research demonstrated an in situ, controlled way to tailor and optimize
      the surface structures in micro-size during the 3D printing process for an
      implant with higher osseointegration ability.

TI  - General review of titanium toxicity.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/s40729-019-0162-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Titanium is a commonly used inert bio-implant material within the
      medical and dental fields. Although the use of titanium is thought to be safe
      with a high success rate, in some cases, there are rare reports of problems
      caused by titanium. In most of these problematic reports, only individual reports
      are dominant and comprehensive reporting has not been performed. This
      comprehensive article has been prepared to review the toxicity of titanium
      materials within the medical and dental fields. METHODS: We used online searching
      tools including MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar by
      combining keywords such as "titanium implant toxicity," "titanium implant
      corrosion," "titanium implant allergy," and "yellow nail syndrome." Recently
      updated data has been collected and compiled into one of four categories: "the
      toxicity of titanium," "the toxicity of titanium alloys," "the toxicity of
      titanium implants," and "diseases related to titanium." RESULTS: Recent studies
      with regard to titanium toxicity have been increasing and have now expanded to
      the medical field in addition to the fields of environmental research and basic
      science. Problems that may arise in titanium-based dental implants include the
      generation of titanium and titanium alloy particles and ions deposited into
      surrounding tissues due to the corrosion and wear of implants, resulting in bone 
      loss due to inflammatory reactions, which may lead to osseointegration failure of
      the dental implant. These titanium ions and particles are systemically deposited 
      and can lead to toxic reactions in other tissues such as yellow nail syndrome.
      Additionally, implant failure and allergic reactions can occur due to
      hypersensitivity reactions. Zirconia implants can be considered as an
      alternative; however, limitations still exist due to a lack of long-term clinical
      data. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should pay attention to the use of titanium dental 
      implants and need to be aware of the problems that may arise from the use of
      titanium implants and should be able to diagnose them, in spite of very rare
      occurrence. Within the limitation of this study, it was suggested that we should 
      be aware the rare problems of titanium toxicity.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo studies of Mg-30Sc alloys with different phase structure for
      potential usage within bone.

AB  - Proper alloying magnesium with element scandium (Sc) could transform its
      microstructure from alpha phase with hexagonal closed-packed (hcp) structure into
      beta phase with body-cubic centered (bcc) structure. In the present work, the
      Mg-30wt% Sc alloy with single alpha phase, dual phases (alpha+beta) or beta phase
      microstructure were developed by altering the heat-treatment routines and their
      suitability for usage within bone was comprehensively investigated. The beta
      phased Mg-30wt% Sc alloy showed the best mechanical performance with ultimate
      compressive strength of 603+/-39MPa and compressive strain of 31+/-3%. In vitro
      degradation test showed that element scandium could effectively incorporate into 
      the surface corrosion product layer, form a double-layered structure, and further
      protect the alloy matrix. No cytotoxic effect was observed for both single alpha 
      phased and beta phased Mg-30wt% Sc alloys on MC3T3 cell line. Moreover, the beta 
      phased Mg-30wt%Sc alloy displayed acceptable corrosion resistance in vivo
      (0.06mmy(-1)) and maintained mechanical integrity up to 24weeks. The degradation 
      process did not significantly influence the hematology indexes of inflammation,
      hepatic or renal functions. The bone-implant contact ratio of 75+/-10% after
      24weeks implied satisfactory integration between beta phased Mg-30wt%Sc alloy and
      the surrounding bone. These findings indicate a potential usage of the
      bcc-structured Mg-Sc alloy within bone and might provide a new strategy for
      future biomedical magnesium alloy design. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Scandium is 
      the only rare earth element that can transform the matrix of magnesium alloy into
      bcc structure, and Mg-30wt%Sc alloy had been recently reported to exhibit shape
      memory effect. The aim of the present work is to study the feasibility of
      Mg-30wt%Sc alloy with different constitutional phases (single alpha phase, single
      beta phase or dual phases (alpha+beta)) as biodegradable orthopedic implant by in
      vitro and in vivo testings. Our findings showed that beta phased Mg-30wt%Sc alloy
      which is of bcc structure exhibited improved strength and superior in vivo
      degradation performance (0.06mmy(-1)). No cytotoxicity and systematic toxicity
      were shown for beta phased Mg-30wt%Sc alloy on MC3T3 cell model and rat
      organisms. Moreover, good osseointegration, limited hydrogen gas release and
      maintained mechanical integrity were observed after 24weeks' implantation into
      the rat femur bone.

      sputtering for biomedical applications: A review.

AB  - Coatings based on ion-substituted calcium phosphate (Ca-P) have attracted great
      attention in the scientific community over the past decade for the development of
      biomedical applications. Among such Ca-P based structures, hydroxyapatite (HA)
      has shown significant influence on cell behaviors including cell proliferation,
      adhesion, and differentiation. These cell behaviors determine the
      osseointegration between the implant and host bone and the biocompatibility of
      implants. This review presents a critical analysis on the physical vapor
      deposition magnetron sputtering (PVDMS) technique that has been used for
      ion-substituted Ca-P based coatings on implants materials. The effect of PVDMS
      processing parameters such as discharge power, bias voltage, deposition time,
      substrate temperature, and post-heat treatment on the surface properties of
      ion-substituted Ca-P coatings is elucidated. Moreover, the advantages, short
      comings and future research directions of Ca-P coatings by PVDMS have been
      comprehensively analyzed. It is revealed that the topography and surface
      chemistry of amorphous HA coatings influence the cell behavior, and
      ion-substituted HA coatings significantly increase cell attachment but may result
      in a cytotoxic effect that reduces the growth of the cells attached to the
      coating surface areas. Meanwhile, low-crystalline HA coatings exhibit lower rates
      of osteogenic cell proliferation as compared to highly crystalline HA coatings
      developed on Ti based surfaces. PVDMS allows a close reproduction of bioapatite
      characteristics with high adhesion strength and substitution of therapeutic ions.
      It can also be used for processing nanostructured Ca-P coatings on polymeric
      biomaterials and biodegradable metals and alloys with enhanced corrosion
      resistance and biocompatibility. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Recent studies have
      utilized the physical vapor deposition magnetron sputtering (PVDMS) for the
      deposition of Ca-P and ion-substituted Ca-P thin film coatings on orthopedic and 
      dental implants. This review explains the effect of PVDMS processing parameters, 
      such as discharge power, bias voltage, deposition time, substrate temperature,
      and post-heat treatment, on the surface morphology and crystal structure of
      ion-substituted Ca-P and ion-substituted Ca-P thin coatings. It is revealed that 
      coating thickness, surface morphology and crystal structure of ion-substituted
      Ca-P coatings via PVDMS directly affect the biocompatibility and cell responses
      of such structures. The cell responses determine the osseointegration between the
      implant and host bone and eventually the success of the implants.

TI  - Auricular prostheses attached to osseointegrated implants: multidisciplinary
      work-up and clinical evaluation.
PG  - 1017-1027
LID - 10.1007/s00405-019-05311-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Not long after the introduction of osseointegrated implants outside the 
      oral cavity, auricular prostheses are retrained on osseointegrated implants. New 
      insights have been gained with the next-generation percutaneous osseointegrated
      titanium implants for bone conduction hearing since its introduction in 2010. As 
      a result, the same technology was introduced in the Vistafix((R)) system (VXI
      implant) to retain auricular prostheses. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      surgical procedure, clinical outcome, and satisfaction of the patient of
      osseointegration-retained auricular prosthesis using VXI implants. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: 11 patients who received an auricular prosthesis using VXI implants
      between December 2012 and November 2017 were evaluated retrospectively. The
      patient's medical files were reviewed to assess clinical complications and the
      necessity for revision surgery. The subjective outcome was measured using the
      Glasgow benefit inventory (GBI). RESULTS: In total, 31 implants were placed in 11
      patients. None of these implants were lost nor revision surgery needed. An
      adverse skin reaction was observed in 13.0% of the implants and in 27.2% of the
      patients, adequately treated with an antibiotic ointment. The average follow-up
      time was 2 years and 7 months. The GBI displayed a positive score in every
      patient. CONCLUSIONS: The VXI implants used are a safe and reliable treatment
      option for retaining auricular prostheses in patients with an absent auricle.
      Patients were satisfied with their auricular prosthesis and showed benefit in
      quality of life. Studies with larger numbers and preferably a prospective
      character are needed to draw statistically significant conclusions.

TI  - Bone healing dynamics associated with 3 implants with different surfaces:
      histologic and histomorphometric analyses in dogs.
PG  - 25-38
LID - 10.5051/jpis.2019.49.1.25 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: This study evaluated differences in bone healing and remodeling among 3 
      implants with different surfaces: sandblasting and large-grit acid etching (SLA; 
      IS-III Active((R))), SLA with hydroxyapatite nanocoating (IS-III Bioactive((R))),
      and SLA stored in sodium chloride solution (SLActive((R))). Methods: The
      mandibular second, third, and fourth premolars of 9 dogs were extracted. After 4 
      weeks, 9 dogs with edentulous alveolar ridges underwent surgical placement of 3
      implants bilaterally and were allowed to heal for 2, 4, or 12 weeks. Histologic
      and histomorphometric analyses were performed on 54 stained slides based on the
      following parameters: vertical marginal bone loss at the buccal and lingual
      aspects of the implant (b-MBL and l-MBL, respectively), mineralized
      bone-to-implant contact (mBIC), osteoid-to-implant contact (OIC), total
      bone-to-implant contact (tBIC), mineralized bone area fraction occupied (mBAFO), 
      osteoid area fraction occupied (OAFO), and total bone area fraction occupied
      (tBAFO) in the threads of the region of interest. Two-way analysis of variance (3
      types of implant surfacex3 healing time periods) and additional analyses for
      simple effects were performed. Results: Statistically significant differences
      were observed across the implant surfaces for OIC, mBIC, tBIC, OAFO, and tBAFO.
      Statistically significant differences were observed over time for l-MBL, mBIC,
      tBIC, mBAFO, and tBAFO. In addition, an interaction effect between the implant
      surface and the healing time period was observed for mBIC, tBIC, and mBAFO.
      Conclusions: Our results suggest that implant surface wettability facilitates
      bone healing dynamics, which could be attributed to the improvement of early
      osseointegration. In addition, osteoblasts might become more activated with the
      use of HA-coated surface implants than with hydrophobic surface implants in the
      remodeling phase.

TI  - Optimized Surface Characteristics and Enhanced in Vivo Osseointegration of
      Alkali-Treated Titanium with Nanonetwork Structures.
LID - E1127 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms20051127 [doi]
AB  - Alkali-treated titanium (Ti) with a porous, homogeneous, and uniform nanonetwork 
      structure (TNS) that enables establishment of a more rapid and firmer
      osteointegration than titanium has recently been reported. However, the
      mechanisms underlying the enhanced osteogenic activity on TNS remains to be
      elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the surface physicochemical properties
      of Ti and TNS, and investigate osteoinduction and osteointegration in vivo.
      Surface characteristics were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
      scanning probe microscopy (SPM), and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), and 
      the surface electrostatic force of TNS was determined using solid zeta potential.
      This study also evaluated the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human 
      plasma fibronectin (HFN) on Ti and TNS surfaces using quartz crystal microbalance
      (QCM) sensors, and apatite formation on Ti and TNS surfaces was examined using a 
      simulated body fluid (SBF) test. Compared with Ti, the newly developed TNS
      enhanced BSA and HFN absorbance capacity and promoted apatite formation.
      Furthermore, TNS held less negative charge than Ti. Notably, sequential
      fluorescence labeling and microcomputed tomography assessment indicated that TNS 
      screws implanted into rat femurs exhibited remarkably enhanced osteointegration
      compared with Ti screws. These results indicate that alkali-treated titanium
      implant with a nanonetwork structure has considerable potential for future
      clinical applications in dentistry and orthopedics.

TI  - PEEK surface modification by fast ambient-temperature sulfonation for bone
      implant applications.
PG  - 20180955
LID - 10.1098/rsif.2018.0955 [doi]
AB  - We develop a simple, fast and economical surface treatment under ambient
      temperature to improve the hydrophilicity and osteoconductivity of
      polyetheretherketone (PEEK) for bone implant applications. A major challenge in
      bone implants is the drastic difference in stiffness between traditional implant 
      materials (such as titanium and stainless steel) and human bone. PEEK is
      biocompatible with an elastic modulus closely matching that of human bone, making
      it a highly attractive alternative. However, its bio-inert and poorly hydrophilic
      surface presents a serious challenge for osseointegration. Sulfonation can
      improve hydrophilicity and introduce bioactive sulfonate groups, but PEEK
      sulfonation has traditionally been applied for fuel cells, employing elevated
      temperatures and long reaction times to re-cast PEEK into sulfonated films.
      Little research has systematically studied PEEK surface modification by short
      reaction time (seconds) and ambient-temperature sulfonation for biomedical
      applications. Here, we investigate three ambient-temperature sulfonation
      treatments under varying reaction times (5-90 s) and evaluate the hydrophilicity 
      and morphology of 15 modified PEEK surfaces. We establish an optimal treatment
      using 30 s H2SO4 followed by 20 s rinsing, and then 20 s immersion in NaOH
      followed by 20 s rinsing. This 30 s ambient-temperature sulfonation is found to
      be more effective than conventional plasma treatments and reduced PEEK water
      contact angle from 78 degrees to 37 degrees .

AB  - Osseointegration of metallic implants in porous osteoporotic bone remains a
      challenge. Surface modification of implants to reduce peri-implant osteoclastic
      bone resorption was explored in the study. Bioinspired polydopamine (pDOP) and
      polyphenol tannic acid (pTAN) are nature-derived universal coating systems that
      have emerged either as a sole coating or ad-layer for biomolecular conjugation on
      different biomaterials. The effects pDOP and pTAN on osteoclast development have 
      not been reported before. In this study, osteoclast development was investigated 
      on titanium (Ti) substrates coated with pDOP (Ti-pDOP) and pTAN (Ti-pTAN). The
      results showed that Ti-pDOP and Ti-pTAN coating reduced tartrate-resistant acid
      phosphatase activity and osteoclast cell number as compared with pristine Ti.
      Intriguingly, the reduction was higher on Ti-pTAN than on Ti-pDOP. Economical and
      biocompatible tannic acid serves as a superior coating in decreasing osteoclast
      activity when compared with that of pDOP coating and could be used to modulate
      osteoclast activity at bone-implant interfaces.

TI  - Effect of Different Surface Treatments on Titanium Dental Implant
      Micro-Morphology.
LID - E733 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma12050733 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Titanium dental implants are today widely used with osseointegration 
      mainly dependently on the implant surface properties. Different processing routes
      lead to different surface characteristics resulting, of course, in different in
      situ behaviors of the implants. MATERIALS: The effect of different treatments,
      whether mechanical or chemical, on the surface morphology of titanium implants
      were investigated. To this aim, various experimental methods, including roughness
      analysis as well scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations, were applied.
      RESULTS: The results showed that, in contrast to the mechanical treatments, the
      chemical ones gave rise to a more irregular surface. SEM observations suggested
      that where commercial pure titanium was used, the chemical treatments provided
      implant surfaces without contaminations. In contrast, sandblasted implants could 
      cause potential risks of surface contamination because of the presence of
      blasting particles remnants. CONCLUSIONS: The examined implant surfaces showed
      different roughness levels in relation to the superficial treatment applied. The 
      acid-etched surfaces were characterized by the presence of deeper valleys and
      higher peaks than the sandblasted surfaces. For this reason, acid-etched surfaces
      can be more easily damaged by the stress produced by the peri-implant bone during
      surgical implant placement.

AB  - Percutaneous osseointegrated bone conduction auditory devices provide excellent
      auditory rehabilitation. Device-related complications relate to skin abutment
      interface and cosmetic concerns, resulting in the development of transcutaneous
      devices. The Sophono and Baha Attract are safe and considered cosmetically
      superior to the percutaneous Baha Connect and Ponto. They provide excellent
      auditory enhancement; however, owing to indirect connectivity between processor
      and implant, there is on average 5- to 7-db less gain when compared with
      percutaneous bone-anchored implants. Surgical implantation of either device is
      usually performed under monitored sedation, in an ambulatory setting, with less
      than a 1-hour operative time, and minimal complications.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of implant inclinations and 
      load times on stress distributions in the peri-implant bone based on immediate-
      and delayed-loading models. Four 3D FEA models with different inclination angle
      of the posterior implants (0 degrees , 15 degrees , 30 degrees , 45 degrees )
      were constructed. A static load of 150 N in the multivectoral direction was
      applied unilaterally to the cantilever region. The stress distributions in the
      peri-implant bone were evaluated before and after osseointegration. The principal
      tensile stress (sigmamax), mean principal tensile stress (sigmamax), principal
      compressive stress (sigmamin) and mean principal compressive stress (sigmamin) of
      the bone and micromotion at the contact interface between the bone and implants
      were calculated. In all the models, peak principal stresses occurred in the bone 
      surrounding the left tilted implant. The highest sigmamax and sigmamin were all
      observed in the 0 degrees model for both immediate- and delayed-loading models.
      And the 0 degrees and 15 degrees models showed higher sigmamax and sigmamin
      values. The 0 degrees models showed the largest micromotion. The observed stress 
      distribution was better in the 30 degrees and 45 degrees models than in the 0
      degrees and 15 degrees models.

TI  - The effect of low-level estrogen in mandibular bone: An in vivo study.
PG  - 65-70
AB  - Background: Low levels of estrogen can cause osteoporosis and usually occur
      during a woman's menopausal phase. Osteoporosis can lead to bone resorption, the 
      absence of osseointegration, and implant failure. The aim of this study is to
      determine the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1),
      runt-related transcription factor (RUNX2), and osteoblasts in mandibular rats
      with low levels of estrogen. Materials and Methods: This study is an in vivo
      experimental research. Female Wistar rats (n = 18) were divided into two groups: 
      (1) Postsham surgery and (2) ovariectomy group. After 12 weeks, the rats were
      sacrificed to identify the level of estrogen, while histological analysis was
      conducted to determine the level of osteoblast and the expression of TGF-beta1
      and RUNX2. The data were analyzed using t-test (P < 0.05). Results: There were
      significant lower levels of estrogen and osteoblast among the ovariectomy group
      compared to the postsham group (P < 0.05). RUNX2 levels were found to be
      significantly higher in the ovariectomy group than that in the postsham group (P 
      < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between TGF-beta1 levels 
      within the ovariectomy and postsham groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Ovariectomy
      can lead to decreased osteoblastogenesis in mandibular bone by the reduced level 
      of osteoblast and the increased expression of TGF-beta1 and RUNX2.

TI  - TGF-beta activity in acid bone lysate adsorbs to titanium surface.
PG  - 336-343
LID - 10.1111/cid.12734 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Osteoblasts lay down new bone on implant surfaces. The underlying
      cellular mechanism and the spatio-temporal mode of action, however, remain
      unclear. It can be proposed that growth factors released upon acidification by
      osteoclasts adsorb to the implant surface and control the early stages of
      osseointegration. METHODS: To simulate bone lysis by osteoclasts, titanium discs 
      were exposed to acid bone lysate (ABL) followed by vigorous washing and seeding
      of oral fibroblasts. The expression of TGF-beta target genes interleukin 11
      (IL11) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) was evaluated by reverse transcriptase
      polymerase chain reaction and IL11 ELISA. TGF-beta signaling activation was
      assessed via Smad2/3 immunofluorescence. The impact of ABL on osteogenic
      differentiation was determined with murine ST2 mesenchymal stromal cells.
      RESULTS: We report here that ABL-conditioned titanium discs, independent of
      turned or rough surface, increased the expression of IL11 and NOX4. This increase
      was blocked by the TGF-beta receptor 1 antagonist SB431542. Further support for
      the TGF-beta signaling activation came from the translocation of Smad2/3 into the
      nucleus of oral fibroblasts. Moreover, titanium discs exposed to ABL decreased
      alkaline phosphatase and osteopontin in ST2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro
      findings suggest that titanium can adsorb TGF-beta from ABLs. The data provide a 
      strong impetus for studies on the protein adsorption on implant surfaces in vitro
      and in vivo, specifically for growth factors including bone-derived TGF-beta
      during successful and failed osseointegration.

TI  - On osseointegration in relation to implant surfaces.
PG  - 4-7

AB  - BACKGROUND: The understanding of mechanisms of osseointegration as well as
      applied knowledge about oral implant surfaces are of paramount importance for
      successful clinical results. PURPOSE: The aim of the present article is to
      present an overview of osseointegration mechanisms and an introduction to surface
      innovations with relevance for osseointegration that will be published in the
      same supplement of Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The present article is a narrative review of some osseointegration and
      implant surface-related details. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Osseointegration has a 
      changed definition since it is realized today that oral implants are but foreign 
      bodies and that this fact explains osseointegration as a protection mechanism of 
      the tissues. Given adequate stability, bone tissue is formed around titanium
      implants to shield them from the tissues. Oral implant surfaces may be
      characterized by microroughness and nanoroughness, by surface chemical
      composition and by physical and mechanical parameters. An isotropic, moderately
      rough implant surface such as seen on the TiUnite device has displayed improved
      clinical results compared to previously used minimally rough or rough surfaces.
      However, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting any particular type of
      nanoroughness pattern that, at best, is documented with results from animal
      studies. It is possible, but as yet unproven, that clinical results may be
      supported by a certain chemical composition of the implant surface. The same can 
      be said with respect to hydrophilicity of implant surfaces; positive animal data 
      may suggest some promise, but there is a lack of clinical evidence that
      hydrophilic implants result in improved clinical outcome of more hydrophobic
      surfaces. With respect to mechanical properties, it seems obvious that those must
      be encompassing the loading of oral implants, but we need more research on the
      mechanically ideal implant surface from a clinical aspect.

TI  - Quantitative in vitro comparison of the thrombogenicity of commercial dental
      implants.
PG  - 8-14
LID - 10.1111/cid.12737 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental implants often have surface modifications that alter surface
      topography and chemistry to improve osseointegration and thereby increase
      treatment predictability. Surface contact-induced blood coagulation is associated
      with the onset of osseointegration. PURPOSE: To quantitatively evaluate the
      thrombogenicity of two commercially available dental implants that have similar
      surface roughness but different surface chemistry. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two
      commercially available dental implants with anodized or sandblasted acid-etched
      surfaces were evaluated for thrombogenic properties. Thrombogenicity was assessed
      by incubating implants for 1 hour in fresh, partially heparinized blood followed 
      by hemocyte quantification, microscopic evaluation, and quantification of
      thrombogenic biomarkers. RESULTS: Fibrin coverage was significantly higher on the
      anodized surface compared with the sandblasted acid-etched surface (P < 0.0001). 
      Platelet and white blood cell attachment followed a similar pattern. The
      increased thrombogenicity was confirmed based on a significant increase in the
      levels of the coagulation cascade biomarkers, thrombin antithrombin complex, and 
      beta-thromboglobulin (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dental implants with comparable 
      roughness but differing surface chemistry had differing extents of blood contact 
      activation. These data suggest that surface chemistry from anodization augments
      implant thrombogenicity compared with that from sandblasting and acid-etching,
      which could have implications for osseointegration.

TI  - Titanium Powder Coating Using Metal 3D Printing: A Novel Coating Technology for
      Cobalt-Chromium Alloy Implants.
PG  - 11-18
LID - 10.1007/s13770-018-0168-0 [doi]
AB  - Background: Three-dimensional (3D) printing with a direct metal fabrication (DMF)
      technology has been innovatively introduced in the field of surface treatment of 
      prostheses. The purpose of this study was to determine whether such modifications
      on the surface of cobalt-chromium (CoCr) alloy by titanium powder coating using
      DMF improves the osseointegration ability of CoCr alloy. Methods: We compared the
      in vitro and in vivo ability of cells to adhere to DMF-coated CoCr alloy with
      machining. Biological and morphological responses to human osteoblast cell lines 
      were examined by measuring cell proliferation rate and observing expression of
      actin filament. For in vivo study, we inserted different specimens in each
      medulla of the distal femurs of rabbit. After 3 months, the distal femurs were
      harvested, and a push-out test and histomorphometric analyses were performed.
      Results: The cell proliferation rate and cell adhesion in the DMF group were
      higher compared with those in the machined group. Human osteoblast cells on the
      DMF-coated surface were more strongly adhered and well-proliferated compared with
      those on the other surface. In the in vivo test, there was a significant
      difference in the ultimate shear strength between the DMF and machined groups
      (2.49 MPa vs. 0.87 MPa, respectively, p = 0.001). In the histomorphometric
      analysis, there was a significant difference in the mean bone-to-implant contact 
      percentages between the DMF and machined groups (72.3 +/- 6.2% vs. 47.6 +/- 6.9%,
      respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Titanium coating of CoCr alloy with 3D
      metal printing provides optimal surface characteristics and a good biological
      surface both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Additive manufacturing (3D printing) is emerging as a key manufacturing technique
      in medical devices. Selective laser melted (SLM) Ti-6Al-4V implants with
      interconnected porosity have become widespread in orthopedic applications where
      porous structures encourage bony ingrowth and the stiffness of the implant can be
      tuned to reduce stress shielding. The SLM technique allows high resolution
      control over design, including the ability to introduce porosity with spatial
      variations in pore size, shape, and connectivity. This study investigates the
      effect of construct design and surface treatment on tensile fatigue behavior of
      3D printed Ti-6Al-4V. Samples were designed as solid, solid with an additional
      surface porous layer, or fully porous, while surface treatments included
      commercially available rotopolishing and SILC cleaning. All groups were evaluated
      for surface roughness and tested in tension to failure under monotonic and cyclic
      loading profiles. Surface treatments were shown to reduce surface roughness for
      all sample geometries. However, only fatigue behavior of solid samples was
      improved for treated as compared to non-treated surfaces Irrespective of surface 
      treatment and resulting surface roughness, the fatigue strength of 3D printed
      samples containing bulk or surface porosity was approximately 10% of the ultimate
      tensile strength of identical 3D printed porous material. This study highlights
      the relative effect of surface treatment in solid and porous printed samples and 
      the inherent decrease in fatigue properties of 3D printed porous samples designed
      for osseointegration.

TI  - Influence of nanoporous titanium niobium alloy surfaces produced via hydrogen
      peroxide oxidative etching on the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal
      stromal cells.

AB  - Titanium niobium alloys exhibit a lower stiffness compared to Ti6Al4V, the 'gold 
      standard' for load-bearing bone implants. Thus, the critical mismatch in
      stiffness between the implant and adjacent bone tissue could be addressed with
      TiNb alloys and thereby reduce stress shielding, which can result in bone
      resorption and subsequent implant loosening; however, the cellular response on
      the specific material is crucial for sufficient osseointegration. We therefore
      hypothesize that the response of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) and
      osteoblast-like cells on Ti45Nb surfaces can be improved by a novel nanoporous
      surface structure. For this purpose, an etching technique using hydrogen peroxide
      electrolyte solution was applied to Ti45Nb. The treated surfaces were
      characterized using SEM, LSM, AFM, nanoindentation, and contact angle
      measurements. Cell culture experiments using hMCS and MG-63 were conducted. The
      H2O2 treatment resulted in surface nanopores, an increase in surface wettability 
      and a reduction in surface hardness. The proliferation of MG-63 was enhanced on
      TiNb45 compared to Ti6Al4V. MG-63 focal adhesion complexes were detected on all
      Ti45Nb surfaces, whereas the nanostructures notably increased the cell area and
      decreased cell solidity, indicating stimulated cell spreading and pseudopodia
      formation. Alizarin red stainings indicated that the nanoporous surfaces
      stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of hMSC. It can be concluded that the
      proposed surface treatment could potentially help to stimulate the
      osseointegration behaviour of the advantageous low stiff Ti45Nb alloy.

AB  - Titanium and its alloys have been used as implant materials. Non-ideal
      osseointegration of the implant materials has facilitated the development of the 
      bioactive coatings on the implant surfaces. In this work, the bioactive calcium
      silicate (CaSi) powder prepared in a green synthesis route was used to cover the 
      surface of Ti implants by a facile electrospray deposition method. Post annealing
      in air was also applied to form the oxidation layer on the Ti surface with the
      aim of increasing the bond strength between the CaSi coating layer and Ti
      substrate. For the characterization of the coatings several analytical methods
      such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, secondary neutral mass
      spectrometry, and Raman-spectroscopy were used, in addition to the measurement of
      bond strength and corrosion resistance. The results indicated a uniform CaSi
      layer with a thickness of about 1mum deposited on the Ti substrate. Annealing in 
      the range of 700-900 degrees C in air resulted in the formation of rutile phase
      of TiO2; more importantly, annealing at 800 degrees C did not significantly
      affect the composition of the CaSi layer consisting of beta-Ca2SiO4. The bond
      strength between the coating layer and Ti substrate can be remarkably enhanced at
      an annealing temperature of 700 or 800 degrees C compared with the as-prepared
      coating without annealing. The annealed coatings had a better corrosion
      resistance than the as-prepared coating. It is concluded that the electrospray
      method associated with the post-annealing can be successfully used for the
      deposition of a CaSi layer with a defined structure and composition on titanium
      implants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zirconia has emerged as a versatile dental material due to its
      excellent aesthetic outcomes such as color and opacity, unique mechanical
      properties that can mimic the appearance of natural teeth and decrease
      peri-implant inflammatory reactions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to
      critically explore the state of art of zirconia surface treatment to enhance the 
      biological and osseointegration behavior of zirconia in implant dentistry.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search in PubMed database was carried out
      until May 2018 using the following combination of key words and MeSH terms
      without time periods: "zirconia surface treatment" or "zirconia surface
      modification" or "zirconia coating" and "osseointegration" or "biological
      properties" or "bioactivity" or "functionally graded properties". RESULTS:
      Previous studies have reported the influence of zirconia-based implant surface on
      the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of osteoblast and fibroblasts at
      the implant to bone interface during the osseointegration process. A large number
      of physicochemical methods have been used to change the implant surfaces and
      therefore to improve the early and late bone-to-implant integration, namely: acid
      etching, gritblasting, laser treatment, UV light, CVD, and PVD. The development
      of coatings composed of silica, magnesium, graphene, dopamine, and bioactive
      molecules has been assessed although the development of a functionally graded
      material for implants has shown encouraging mechanical and biological behavior.
      CONCLUSION: Modified zirconia surfaces clearly demonstrate faster
      osseointegration than that on untreated surfaces. However, there is no consensus 
      regarding the surface treatment and consequent morphological aspects of the
      surfaces to enhance osseointegration.

TI  - Rational design and in vitro characterization of novel dental implant and
      abutment surfaces for balancing clinical and biological needs.
PG  - 15-24
LID - 10.1111/cid.12736 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term success and patient satisfaction of dental implant systems 
      can only be achieved by fulfilling clinical as well as biological needs related
      to maintenance, aesthetics, soft tissue sealing, and osseointegration, among
      others. Surface properties largely contribute to the biological and clinical
      performance of implants and abutments. PURPOSE: To decipher the clinical and
      biological needs in implant dentistry. To address identified needs,
      next-generation dental implant and abutment surfaces are designed and
      characterized in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Novel implant and abutment surface
      designs were produced and characterized using surface chemical analysis, surface 
      topography analysis, scanning electron microscopy, contact-angle measurements,
      and cell-culture experiments. RESULTS: The novel anodized implant surface was
      gradually anodized, increasing the surface roughness, surface enlargement, and
      oxide-layer thickness from platform to apex. The surface was phosphorus enriched,
      nonporous, and nanostructured at the collar, and showed micropores elsewhere. The
      novel anodized abutment surface was smooth, nanostructured, nonporous, and
      yellow. Pristine surfaces with high density of hydroxyl-groups were protected
      during storage using a removable cell-friendly layer that allowed dry packaging. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A novel anodized implant system was developed with surface
      chemistry, topography, nanostructure, color, and surface energy designed to
      balance the clinical and biological needs at every tissue level.

TI  - Towards osteogenic and bactericidal nanopatterns?
PG  - 20LT01
LID - 10.1088/1361-6528/ab0a3a [doi]
AB  - Recent discoveries have shown that nanopatterns with feature sizes </=100 nm
      could direct stem cell fate or kill bacteria. These effects could be used to
      develop orthopedic implants with improved osseointegration and decreased chance
      of implant-associated infections. The quest for osteogenic and bactericidal
      nanopatterns is ongoing but no controlled nanopatterns with dual osteogenic and
      bactericidal functionalities have been found yet. In this study, electron beam
      induced deposition (EBID) was used for accurate and reproducible decoration of
      silicon surfaces with four different types of nanopatterns. The features used in 
      the first two nanopatterns (OST1 and OST2) were derived from osteogenic
      nanopatterns known to induce osteogenic differentiation of stem cells in the
      absence of osteogenic supplements. Two modifications of these nanopatterns were
      also included (OST2-SQ, OST2-H90) to study the effects of controlled disorder and
      lower nanopillar heights. An E. coli K-12 strain was used for probing the
      response of bacteria to the nanopatterns. Three nanopatterns (OST2, OST2-SQ, and 
      OST2-H90) exhibited clear bactericidal behavior as evidenced by severely damaged 
      cells and disrupted formation of extracellular polymeric substance. These
      findings indicate that controlled nanopatterns with features derived from
      osteogenic ones can have bactericidal activity and that EBID represents an
      enabling nanotechnology to achieve (multi)functional nanopatterns for bone
      implants.

TI  - Enhanced Osseointegration Ability of Poly(lactic acid) via Tantalum
      Sputtering-Based Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation.
PG  - 10492-10504
LID - 10.1021/acsami.8b21363 [doi]
AB  - Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is the most utilized biodegradable polymer in orthopedic 
      implant applications because of its ability to replace regenerated bone tissue
      via continuous degradation over time. However, the poor osteoblast affinity for
      PLA results in a high risk of early implant failure, and this issue remains one
      of the most difficult challenges with this technology. In this study, we
      demonstrate the use of a new technique in which plasma immersion ion implantation
      (PIII) is combined with a conventional DC magnetron sputtering. This technique,
      referred to as sputtering-based PIII (S-PIII), makes it possible to produce a
      tantalum (Ta)-implanted PLA surface within 30 s without any tangible degradation 
      or deformation of the PLA substrate. Compared to a Ta-coated PLA surface, the
      Ta-implanted PLA showed twice the surface roughness and substantially enhanced
      adhesion stability in dry and wet conditions. The strong hydrophobic surface
      properties and biologically relatively inert chemical structure of PLA were
      ameliorated by Ta S-PIII treatment, which produced a moderate hydrophilic surface
      and enhanced cell-material interactions. Furthermore, in an in vivo evaluation in
      a rabbit distal femur implantation model, Ta-implanted PLA demonstrated
      significantly enhanced osseointegration and osteogenesis compared with bare PLA. 
      These results indicate that the Ta-implanted PLA has great potential for
      orthopedic implant applications.

TI  - Effects of capsaicin-induced sensory denervation on early implant
      osseointegration in adult rats.
PG  - 181082

AB  - The presence of nerve endings around implants is well-known, but the interaction 
      between the peripheral nervous system and the osseointegration of implants has
      not been thoroughly elucidated to date. The purpose of this study was to test the
      effects of selective sensory denervation on early implant osseointegration. Forty
      male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into two groups, group A and group
      B, and they were treated with capsaicin and normal saline, respectively. One week
      later, titanium implants were placed in the bilateral femurs of the rats. Three
      and six weeks after implantation, histological examination, microcomputed
      tomography and biomechanical testing were performed to observe the effect of
      sensory denervation on implant osseointegration. At three weeks and six weeks,
      bone area, trabecular bone volume/total bone volume and bone density were
      significantly lower in group A than in group B. Similarly, the bone-implant
      contact rate, trabecular number and trabecular thickness were clearly lower in
      group A than in group B at three weeks. However, the trabecular separation
      spacing in group A was greater than that in group B at both time points.
      Biomechanical testing revealed that the implant-bone binding ability of group A
      was significantly lower than that in group B. The research demonstrated that
      sensory innervation played an important role in the formation of
      osseointegration. Selective-sensory denervation could reduce osseointegration and
      lower the binding force of the bone and the implant.

AB  - The attachment of implants relies on bone and soft tissue biocompatibility. The
      aim of this article is to investigate the effect of fluoride-modified metallic
      titanium (Ti) surfaces (Ti-F) on proliferation and differentiation of human
      gingival fibroblasts. Human gingival fibroblast cells were exposed to
      hydrofluoric acid-modified Ti coins (Ti-F) for 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 days, and
      untreated coins were used as controls. A five- to six-fold increase in the
      proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts on Ti-F compared to Ti surfaces was
      observed. Enhanced gene expression of interleukin-6 and osteoprotegerin was found
      at 7 days. Increased levels of sclerostin, interleukin-6 and osteoprotegerin in
      the media from human gingival fibroblasts cultured on Ti-F coins were found
      compared to controls. Our results confirm that hydrofluoric acid-modified surface
      may indirectly enhance the firm attachment of implant surface to junction
      epithelium, soft tissue epithelium, which would give protection for underlying
      osseous structures making osseointegration of the dental implant possible.

TI  - Platelet adhesion on commercially pure titanium plates in vitro I: effects of
      plasma components and involvement of the von Willebrand factor and fibronectin.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1186/s40729-019-0160-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is widely used in regenerative dentistry. 
      Furthermore, it is often applied in the pretreatment of titanium implants to
      improve their surface bioaffinity and initial stability. However, effects of PRP 
      application on implant surface at cellular and molecular levels remain poorly
      understood. Therefore, we examined platelet adhesion on commercially pure
      titanium (cp-Ti) plates, with a particular focus on fibrinogen (FGN), von
      Willebrand factor (vWF), and fibronectin (FN), in the presence or absence of
      plasma components. METHODS: Citrated blood samples were obtained from six healthy
      male volunteers, and pure-PRP (P-PRP) and pure platelet suspensions in
      phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were prepared. Platelet adhesion on cp-Ti plate
      surface was evaluated by phalloidin staining and tetrazolium dye assay.
      Distribution of FGN, vWF, FN, albumin, CD62P, and CD63 was examined by
      immunocytochemical analysis. RESULTS: Platelets in PBS suspensions rapidly and
      time-dependently adhered to cp-Ti plate surface, but this adhesion was
      substantially disturbed by the presence of plasma components. FGN was most
      preferably adsorbed regardless of the presence or absence of plasma components,
      while vWF and FN showed greater accumulation on platelet adhesion area.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although FGN is rapidly and abundantly adsorbed on cp-Ti plate
      surface, vWF and FN function as major platelet adhesion molecules in citrated
      blood samples. After pretreatment with P-PRP, however, platelets adhered to cp-Ti
      much less efficiently. Therefore, P-PRP pretreatment might not directly
      contribute to surface functionalization, initial stabilization, and
      osseointegration of machined or similar types of implants.

TI  - Genome-wide DNA-methylation profiles in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells 
      on titanium surfaces.
PG  - 196-209
LID - 10.1111/eos.12607 [doi]
AB  - The characteristics of titanium (Ti) have been shown to influence dental implant 
      fixation. Treatment of surfaces using the sandblasted, large-grit, acid-etched
      (SLA) method is widely used to provide effective osseointegration. However, the
      DNA methylation-associated mechanism by which SLA surface treatment affects
      osseointegration of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) remains
      elusive. Genome-wide methylation profiling of hBMSCs on SLA-treated and machined 
      smooth Ti was performed using Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip at day 
      7 of osteogenic induction. In total, 2,846 CpG sites were differentially
      methylated in the SLA group compared with the machined group. Of these sites,
      1,651 (covering 1,066 genes) were significantly hypermethylated and 1,195
      (covering 775 genes) were significantly hypomethylated. Thirty significant
      enrichment pathways were observed, with Wnt signaling being the most significant.
      mRNA expression was identified by microarray and combined with DNA-methylation
      profiles. Thirty-seven genes displayed negative association between mRNA
      expression and DNA-methylation level, with the osteogenesis-related genes
      insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and carboxypeptidase X, M14 Family Member 2
      (CPXM2) showing significant up-regulation and down-regulation, respectively. In
      summary, our results demonstrate differences between SLA-treated and machined
      surfaces in their effects on genome-wide DNA methylation and enrichment of
      osteogenic pathways in hBMSCs. We provide novel insights into genes and pathways 
      affected by SLA treatment in hBMSCs at the molecular level.

      vertical alveolar ridge augmentation.
PG  - 502-509
LID - 10.1111/jcpe.13090 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of autoclavation on the efficacy of extracted
      tooth roots (TR) used for vertical alveolar ridge augmentation and two-stage
      osseointegration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Maxillary premolars were randomly
      assigned to either autoclavation (TR-A) or were left untreated (TR-C) and used as
      block grafts for vertical alveolar ridge augmentation in both lower quadrants (n 
      = 4 beagle dogs). At 12 weeks, titanium implants were inserted and left to heal
      for 3 weeks. Histological analyses considered vertical bone gain (BD-BC),
      augmented area (AA) and bone-to-implant contact (BIC) at vestibular (v) and oral 
      (o) aspects. RESULTS: Both TR-C and TR-A (exposures n = 3) grafts were associated
      with a replacement resorption and marked vertical bone gain. Median BD-BC (TR-C: 
      1.45 [v] to 1.62 mm [o] versus TR-A: 0.97 [v] to 1.79 mm [o]) and AA (TR-C: 0.64 
      [v] to 2.36 mm(2) [o] versus TR-A: 0.22 [v] to 2.36 mm(2) [o]) values were
      comparable in both groups. V BIC (TR-C: 49.32 [v] to 52.97% [o] versus TR-A:
      25.34 [v] to 46.11% [o]) values were significantly higher in the TR-C group.
      CONCLUSIONS: Both TR-C and TR-A grafts equally supported vertical alveolar ridge 
      augmentation; however, osseointegration was partially facilitated in the TR-C
      group.

TI  - Effect of interposed tissue and contamination on the initial stability of a
      highly porous press-fit acetabular cup.
PG  - 1117-1122
LID - 10.1002/jor.24253 [doi]
AB  - For biologic fixation, press-fit acetabular cups should have initial stability
      with minimal micromotion and osteoconductive surfaces in contact with bone.
      Inadequate exposure potentially influences initial stability by increasing the
      possibility of soft tissue interposition and contamination at the implant-tissue 
      interface. A sawbone model was used to examine how interposed tissue and
      contamination influence initial cup stability. Seven groups (n = 4) were tested
      with varying levels of interposed fatty and fibrous tissue placed around the rim 
      of the cup. 54 millimeter in diameter highly porous hemispherical acetabular cups
      (Stryker, Mahwah NJ) and 54 mm reamed cavities in sawbone blocks were used.
      Shells were seated and maximum lever out force was recorded for each sample. Cups
      with fibrous tissue spaced evenly along the rim had a lever out force that was
      150% of the control (107 +/- 6 vs. 150 +/- 12N, p = 0.005), and fatty tissue
      contamination had a lever out force that was 140% of the control (143 +/- 18 vs. 
      107 +/- 6N, p = 0.04). Cups with fibrous tissue placed eccentrically along the
      rim had a lever out force that was double the control 107 +/- 6 N vs. 200 +/- 15 
      N (p = 0.001). Surprisingly, fatty tissue contamination and fibrous tissue
      interposition at the rim increased initial stability. The eccentrically
      interposed tissue forced the opposite pole of the cup into the bone, resulting in
      a more secure press-fit. However, soft tissue interposition decreases
      implant/bone apposition, and the effect on long term fixation is unknown.
      Statement of Clinical Significance: Soft tissue interposition between the bone
      and cup may provide higher initial stability, but its long-term effects are
      unknown. (c) 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals,

TI  - Thumb Amputations Treated With Osseointegrated Percutaneous Prostheses With Up to
      25 Years of Follow-up.
PG  - e097
LID - 10.5435/JAAOSGlobal-D-18-00097 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Implantation of an osseointegrated percutaneous prosthesis provides
      a reconstruction alternative for thumb amputation without sacrificing donor
      tissues. Methods: Thirteen thumb amputees received osseointegrated prostheses
      (1990 to 2014). The treatments were started with custom-designed implants. Since 
      2005, standardized implant components and structured rehabilitation protocols
      were introduced. The median follow-up period was 9.5 years. Results: Six patients
      were lost to follow-up. Seven patients (including all six after the introduction 
      of the standardized protocol) had good osseoperception, grip strength (Jamar) was
      28.3 kg on the operated side versus 40.4 kg in the unaffected hand (70%), and key
      grip strength was 6 versus 9.1 kg. Hand function was 94% of the normal hand. The 
      most common complications were mechanical failures necessitating changes of
      components (eight times in three patients) and superficial infections (seven
      times in five patients). Five patients had no complications. The refined implant 
      design and new standardized treatment protocol achieved a 100% cumulative success
      rate with 9.5 years of follow-up so far. Discussion: Treatment of thumb amputees 
      using bone-anchored percutaneous prostheses seems to be a safe, durable method
      with excellent short- and medium-long follow-up results. Severe adverse events
      are few except for implant loosening which occurred only in the early
      custom-designed group.

TI  - Establishing an osteoimmunomodulatory coating loaded with aspirin on the surface 
      of titanium primed with phase-transited lysozyme.
PG  - 977-991
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S190766 [doi]
AB  - Background: To improve osseointegration and enhance the success rate of implanted
      biomaterials, the surface modification technology of bone implants has developed 
      rapidly. Intensive research on osteoimmunomodulation has shown that the surfaces 
      of implants should possess favorable osteoimmunomodulation to facilitate
      osteogenesis. Methods: A novel, green and efficient phase-transited lysozyme
      (PTL) technique was used to prime titanium discs with a positive charge. In
      addition, sodium hyaluronate (HA) and self-assembled type I collagen containing
      aspirin (ASA) nanoparticles were decorated on PTL-primed Ti discs via
      electrostatic interaction. Results: The behaviors of bone marrow stromal cells
      (BMSCs) on the Ti disc surfaces containing ASA were analyzed in different
      conditioned media (CM) generated by macrophages. Additionally, the secretion of
      inflammation-related cytokines of macrophages on the surfaces of different Ti
      discs was investigated in in vitro experiments, which showed that the Ti surface 
      containing ASA not only supported the migration, proliferation and
      differentiation of BMSCs but also reduced the inflammatory response of
      macrophages compared with Ti discs without surface modification. After
      implantation in vivo, the ASA-modified implant can significantly contribute to
      bone formation around the implant, which mirrors the evaluation in vitro.
      Conclusion: This study highlights the significant effects of appropriate surface 
      characteristics on the regulation of osteogenesis and osteoimmunomodulation
      around an implant. Implant modification with ASA potentially provides superior
      strategies for the surface modification of biomaterials.

TI  - Enhanced Cell Response to Zirconia Surface Immobilized with Type I Collagen.
PG  - 556-563
LID - 10.1177/0022034519828702 [doi]
AB  - Zirconia (ZrO2) dental implants provide good biocompatibility, have good
      corrosion resistance, and have a color that is similar to that of natural teeth. 
      Unfortunately, ZrO2 is a bioinert material and therefore achieves
      osseointegration difficultly. In this study, we sought to enhance
      osseointegration by producing rough ZrO2 surfaces that contain hydroxyl groups
      (designated ZSA) through the use of sandblasting in conjunction with alkaline
      treatment. We immobilized type I collagen on ZSA surfaces using the natural
      cross-linker, procyanidin. Our results further showed that surfaces produced in
      ZSA-P/C featured more and steadier type I collagen than surfaces produced in
      ZSA-C. The ZSA-P/C also presented superior cell responses in terms of adhesion,
      proliferation, and mineralization of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.
      The enhanced cell responses in the ZSA-P/C were induced through the prolonged
      activation of focal adhesion kinase, AKT (the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway),
      and p38 (the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway). The simple and novel
      approach to immobilize type I collagen on roughened ZrO2 surfaces presented in
      this article can likely benefit dental implant applications.

TI  - Current state-of-the-art and future perspectives of the three main modern
      implant-dentistry concerns: Aesthetic requirements, mechanical properties, and
      peri-implantitis prevention.
PG  - 1466-1475
LID - 10.1002/jbm.a.36661 [doi]
AB  - The idea of permanent tooth replacement goes back to the year 2000 BC at least,
      when carved bamboo pegs were used to replace missing teeth in ancient China. The 
      phenomenon of osseointegration, however, was not verified until the mid-1960s,
      when Branemark discovered that titanium could integrate to bone. Since then, the 
      osseointegration capacity of implants has been profoundly investigated and
      implants as such have evolved enormously in all possible aspects, from material
      selection and processing to specific surface engineering, among many others. This
      review article, in particular, focuses on dental implants and aims to introduce
      the main concerns involved in modern dentistry, concentrating especially on the
      importance of finding an effective way to prevent peri-implantitis. In this
      sense, strategies such as shifting from metal to ceramic implant components and
      applying novel antimicrobial antibiotic-free coatings seem to be taking the lead.

AB  - This clinical report describes the integration of digital technology into the
      treatment of a patient with an osseointegrated implant-retained nasal prosthesis.
      The surgery was planned digitally to determine the optimal implant positions.
      Implant placement surgical guides were digitally designed and additively
      manufactured. Prosthetic components, including the nasal form and substructure,
      were simulated digitally. Based on this simulated prosthetic model,
      patient-specific abutments were digitally designed and copy-milled. Prototypes
      for the substructure and prosthesis were 3D printed. Spectrophotometry and
      computerized color formulation were used to generate the silicone base color of
      the prosthesis, and characterization was performed by eye. The integration of
      digital technology allowed for optimized prosthetic retention, predictable
      esthetic outcomes, and reduced patient appointment time.

TI  - Osseointegration of Alkali-Modified NANOZR Implants: An In Vivo Study.

LID - 10.3390/ijms20040842 [doi]
AB  - Ingredients and surface modification methods are being continually developed to
      improve osseointegration of dental implants and reduce healing times. In this
      study, we demonstrate in vitro that, by applying concentrated alkali treatment to
      NANOZR with strong bending strength and fracture toughness, a significant
      improvement in the bone differentiation of rat bone marrow cells can be achieved.
      We investigated the influence of materials modified with this treatment in vivo, 
      on implanted surrounding tissues using polychrome sequential fluorescent labeling
      and micro-computer tomography scanning. NANOZR implant screws in the
      alkali-treated group and the untreated group were evaluated after implantation in
      the femur of Sprague(-)Dawley male rats, indicating that the amount of new bone
      in the alkali-modified NANOZR was higher than that of unmodified NANOZR.
      Alkali-modified NANOZR implants proved to be useful for the creation of new
      implant materials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Chinese medicine icariin with osteoinduction and osteogenesis
      abilities is loaded onto the surface of TiO2 nanotubes to form icariin/TiO2
      nanotube composite coating, which can synergistically enhance the
      osseointegration around the implant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: However, the
      half-life of icariin is short, and the sustained release effect of TiO2 nanotubes
      cannot meet the long-term stable drug release requirement. Therefore, in order to
      enhance the sustained release effect of icariin/TiO2 nanotube composite coating, 
      in this study, polymer PLGA was applied to the composite coating by overlay
      method and mixing method. Scanning electron microscopy and release detection were
      performed to study the effects of two PLGA loading methods on the loading and
      early release of composite coatings. RESULTS: Results showed that the PLGA
      loading and sustained release effect was stronger than that of TiO2 nanotubes.
      The sustained release effect was mainly manifested in the rapid release phase.
      The release time of the TiO2nanotube drug-loaded composite coating was 9 days.
      Overlay method and mixing method extended the drug release time to 12 d and 10 d,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, PLGA can enhance the loading and sustained 
      release properties of icariin/TiO2 nanotube composite coating. Overlay method has
      better sustained release effect, and the mixing method has better loading
      performance.

AB  - The adhesion of human epidermal keratinocytes to the implant surface is one of
      the most critical steps during the patient's recovery from implantation of
      transcutaneous prosthesis. To improve the success rate of transcutaneous
      prosthetic implants, we explored a new "top-down" approach to promoting this
      dynamic adhering process through modulation of upstream cell signaling pathways. 
      To examine the feasibility of this novel approach, we first established an in
      vitro platform that is capable of providing a non-invasive, real-time,
      quantitative characterization of the keratinocyte-implant interaction. This
      platform is based on the dissipation monitoring function of the quartz crystal
      microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) in conjunction with the
      open-module setup of the QCM-D. We then employed this platform to assess the
      effects of various pathways-specific modulators on the adhering process of
      keratinocytes. We demonstrated that this "top-down" approach is as effective in
      enhancing the adhesion of keratinocytes as the conventional "bottom-up" approach 
      that relies on modifying the substrate surface with the adhesion protein such as 
      fibronectin. We envision that this new "top-down" approach combined with the
      QCM-D-based in vitro platform will help facilitate the future development of new 
      therapies for enhancing osseointegration and promoting wound healing.

TI  - Intrasurgical Protein Layer on Titanium Arthroplasty Explants: From the Big
      Twelve to the Implant Proteome.
PG  - e1800168
LID - 10.1002/prca.201800168 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Aseptic loosening in total joint replacement due to insufficient
      osteointegration is an unsolved problem in orthopaedics. The purpose of the study
      is to obtain a picture of the initial protein adsorption layer on femoral
      endoprosthetic surfaces as the key to the initiation of osseointegration.
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The paper describes the first study of femoral stem explants
      from patients for proteome analysis of the primary protein layer. After 2 min in 
      situ, the stems are explanted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Proteins are eluted 
      under reducing conditions and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: After exclusion of
      proteins identified by a single peptide, the implant proteome is found to consist
      of 2802 unique proteins. Of these, 77% are of intracellular origin, 9% are
      derived from the plasma proteome, 8% from the bone proteome, and four proteins
      with highest specificity score could be assigned to the bone marrow proteome
      (transcriptome). The most abundant protein in the adsorbed total protein layer is
      hemoglobin (8-11%) followed by serum albumin (3.6-6%). CONCLUSIONS: A detailed
      knowledge of the initial protein film deposited onto the implants, as
      demonstrated here for the first time, may help to understand and predict the
      response of the osseous microenvironment to implant surfaces.

TI  - Effects of NSAIDs on Periodontal and Dental Implant Therapy.
PG  - e1-e9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly
      prescribed group of drugs in dentistry for managing postoperative pain and
      discomfort. Little is known regarding their effects on the healing of periodontal
      and peri-implant tissues. METHODS: The authors conducted a review of the
      literature to provide an overview of knowledge about NSAIDs and their potential
      effects on periodontal and implant wound healing. RESULTS: A Pubmed (MEDLINE)
      database search was conducted to identify articles evaluating the influence of
      administration of NSAID drugs on outcomes following periodontal treatments (nine 
      clinical studies) and dental implant placement (four animal studies and two human
      clinical studies). Conflicting results were found on the effects of NSAIDs during
      periodontal wound healing. NSAID administration, specifically selective COX-2
      inhibitors could inhibit bone formation around orthopedic implants. CONCLUSION:
      Within the limitations of this review, NSAIDs negatively affected
      osseointegration of titanium implants. However, quality of evidence from
      available human clinical studies is poor and there are conflicting results from
      animal models. Future and better clinical studies are needed to more precisely
      evaluate the potential effects of NSAIDs on dental wound healing. PRACTICAL
      IMPLICATIONS: Dental surgeons must be aware of the potential effects of NSAID use
      on osseous healing following common oral surgical procedures such as periodontal 
      and implant therapy.

AB  - The surface of an implant is important for successful osseointegration and
      long-term stability as it can aid in cell migration and proliferation, cell
      differentiation and allow extracellular matrix production. Earlier studies have
      shown that nanostructuring the surface of titanium can enhance mesenchymal stem
      cell (MSC) migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Although many studies
      have evaluated MSC response on nanostructured surfaces, there are only a few
      studies that have explored the response of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) on
      titania nanotube surfaces. Because ADSC exhibit great potential in regenerative
      medicine and have already proven effective in developing new treatments, this
      study aims to further understand how ADSC interact with titania nanotube
      surfaces. The results of this study indicate that titania nanotube surfaces
      enhance ADSC proliferation and differentiation that is also dependent on the size
      of nanotubes. Additionally, the favorable response of ADSC on nanotube surfaces
      suggests a potential application in orthopedic tissue regeneration.

      Nano Devices Applied to Dental Practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, many advances have been made in the fields of
      bioengineering and biotechnology. Many methods have been proposed for the in
      vitro study of anatomical structures and alloplastic structures. Many steps
      forward have been made in the field of prosthetics and grafts and one of the most
      debated problems lies in the biomimetics and biocompatibility of the materials
      used. The contact surfaces between alloplastic material and fabric are under
      study, and this has meant that the surfaces were significantly improved. To
      ensure a good contact surface with the cells of our body and be able to respond
      to an attack by a biofilm or prevent the formation, this is the true gold
      standard. In the dental field, the study of the surfaces of contact with the bone
      tissue of the implants is the most debated, starting from the first concepts of
      osteointegration. METHOD: The study searched MEDLINE databases from January 2008 
      to November 2018. We considered all the studies that talk about nanosurface and
      the biological response of the latter, considering only avant-garde works in this
      field. RESULTS: The ultimate aim of this study is to point out all the progress
      made in the field of bioengineering and biotechnologies about nanosurface.
      Surface studies allow you to have alloplastic materials that integrate better
      with our body and allow more predictable rehabilitations. Particularly in the
      field of dental implantology the study of surfaces has allowed us to make huge
      steps forward in times of rehabilitation. Overcoming this obstacle linked to the 
      time of osseointegration, however, today the real problem seems to be linked to
      the "pathologies of these surfaces", or the possible infiltration, and formation 
      of a biofilm, difficult to eliminate, being the implant surface, inert.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present investigation demonstrated how
      nanotechnologies contribute substantially to the development of new materials in 
      the biomedical field, being able to perform a large number of tests on the
      surface to advance research. Thanks to 3D technology and to the reconstructions
      of both the anatomical structures and eventually the alloplastic structures used 
      in rehabilitation it is possible to consider all the mechanical characteristics
      too. Recent published papers highlighted how the close interaction between cells 
      and the biomaterial applied to the human body is the main objective in the final 
      integration of the device placed to manage pathologies or for rehabilitation
      after a surgical tumor is removed.

      proliferation via JNK- and ERK-dependent up-regulation of fibroblast growth
      factor-2 by T lymphocytes.
PG  - 997-1010
LID - 10.1177/0885328218816565 [doi]
AB  - Long-term clinical success of a titanium implant not only depends upon
      osseointegration between implant and bone surface but also on the response of
      host immune cells. Following implantation of biomaterials, an inflammatory
      response, including T lymphocyte response, is ostensibly initiated by
      implant-cell interaction. However, little is known about the responses of T
      lymphocytes to titanium dioxide nanotubes. The present study aimed to explore the
      effect of titanium dioxide nanotubes on T lymphocytes in vitro and its biological
      consequences. The results of the present study showed that titanium dioxide
      nanotubes with diameter of 30-105 nm were non-cytotoxic to T lymphocytes, and the
      105 nm titanium dioxide nanotube surface specifically possessed an ability to
      activate T lymphocytes, thus increasing DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. In 
      addition, the 105 nm titanium dioxide nanotubes significantly activated the
      expression of FGF-2 gene and protein in T lymphocytes although smaller nanotubes 
      (i.e. those with diameters of approximately 30 and 70 nm) had little effect on
      this. The present study investigated the mechanism by which 105 nm nanotubes
      stimulated FGF-2 expression in T lymphocytes by blocking key MAPK pathways. The
      inhibitors of JNK1/2/3 and ERK1/2 significantly inhibited 105 nm titanium dioxide
      nanotubes-induced FGF-2 expression. Corresponding to the increased expression of 
      FGF-2, only the supernatant from T lymphocytes cultured on 105 nm nanotubes
      stimulated human mesenchymal stem cell proliferation. FGF-2 blocking antibody
      partially reversed the increased proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells,
      supporting the role of T lymphocyte-derived FGF-2 in enhanced human mesenchymal
      stem cell proliferation. This suggests a significant role of T
      lymphocyte-titanium dioxide nanotube interaction in the proliferation of human
      mesenchymal stem cells, which is pivotal to the formation of new bone following
      implant placement.

TI  - Biomimetic Surfaces Coated with Covalently Immobilized Collagen Type I: An X-Ray

      Histomorphometrical Study in Rabbits.
LID - E724 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms20030724 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The process of osseointegration of dental implants is characterized
      by healing phenomena at the level of the interface between the surface and the
      bone. Implant surface modification has been introduced in order to increase the
      level of osseointegration. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence
      of biofunctional coatings for dental implants and the bone healing response in a 
      rabbit model. The implant surface coated with collagen type I was analyzed
      through X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM),
      micro-CT and histologically. METHODS: The sandblasted and double acid etched
      surface coated with collagen type I, and uncoated sandblasted and double acid
      etched surface were evaluated by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and
      Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis in order evaluate the different
      morphology. In vivo, a total of 36 implants were positioned in rabbit articular
      femoral knee-joint, 18 fixtures for each surface. Micro-CT scans, histological
      and histomorphometrical analysis were conducted at 15, 30 and 60 days. RESULTS: A
      histological statistical differences were evident at 15, 30 and 60 days (p <
      0.001). Both implant surfaces showed a close interaction with newly formed bone. 
      Mature bone appeared in close contact with the surface of the fixture. The AFM
      outcome showed a similar roughness for both surfaces. CONCLUSION: However, the
      final results showed that a coating of collagen type I on the implant surface
      represents a promising procedure able to improve osseointegration, especially in 
      regions with a low bone quality.

TI  - Sex hormone replacement therapy in periodontology-A systematic review.
LID - 10.1111/odi.13059 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse whether sex hormone replacement therapy (HRT) improves
      periodontal parameters and dental implants osseointegration in humans. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Electronic databases and hand searches were performed from June to
      August 2018 in SciELO, LILACS and PubMed/MEDLINE. Human observational and
      interventional studies that evaluated the following parameters were included:
      clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing
      (BOP), radiographic bone loss (RBL) or osseointegration. RESULTS: Initial search 
      retrieved 1,282 non-duplicated articles. Fifteen studies were selected after
      inclusion criteria were applied. All studies were performed in postmenopausal
      women. Mean differences for PPD reduction ranged from 0.02 to 0.2 mm in
      HRT-positive patients; mean CAL gain -0.18 to 0.54 mm; mean RBL reduction -0.87
      to 0.15 mm; and mean BOP reduction 9%-30.3%. Failure rate of dental implants
      increased -5.5% to 11.21% when HRT was used. CONCLUSIONS: Very low but consistent
      evidence suggests a reduction in BOP and no impact on RBL in postmenopausal women
      receiving HRT. There are inconsistent reports that suggest that HRT in
      postmenopausal women: (a) improves or does not impact PPD reduction and CAL gain;
      and (b) does not impact or increase implant loss. In summary, there is no
      evidence to support HRT prescription for either men or women for
      periodontal/implant placement purposes.

TI  - Titanium Surface Properties Influence the Biological Activity and FasL Expression
      of Craniofacial Stromal Cells.
PG  - 4670560
LID - 10.1155/2019/4670560 [doi]
AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can be easily isolated form craniofacial bones
      during routine dentistry procedures. Due to their embryological origin from
      neural crest, they represent a suitable cell population to study cell-biomaterial
      interaction in the craniofacial field, including osteoinductive/osteointegrative 
      processes. The biological and immunomodulatory properties of MSCs may be
      influenced by chemistry and topography of implant surfaces. We investigated if
      and how three different titanium surfaces, machined (MCH), sandblasted with
      resorbable blasting medium (RBM), and Ca(++)-nanostructured (NCA), may affect
      biological activity, osseointegration, and immunomodulatory properties of
      craniofacial MSCs. Cell proliferation, morphology, osteogenic markers, and FasL
      were evaluated on MSCs isolated from the mandibular bone after seeding on these
      three different surfaces. No statistically significant differences in cell
      proliferation were observed whereas different morphologies and growth patterns
      were detected for each type of surface. No difference in the expression of
      osteogenic markers was revealed. Interestingly, FasL expression, involved in the 
      immunomodulatory activity of stem cells, was influenced by surface properties.
      Particularly, immunofluorescence analysis indicated that FasL expression
      increased on MCH surface compared to the others confirming the suggested role of 
      FasL in promoting osteogenic differentiation. Titanium surface treatments and
      topography might reflect different biological behaviours of craniofacial MSCs and
      influence their osseointegration/immunomodulation properties.

TI  - Er:YAG and diode laser application in implant bed preparation and implant
      uncovering: A case report.
PG  - 111-116
LID - 10.17219/dmp/100386 [doi]
AB  - The use of lasers in the field of dentistry has increased recently. Their
      numerous advantages and applications in soft and hard tissue surgeries make them 
      a great alternative to conservative methods in dental implantology. The most
      commonly used lasers are diode and erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Er:YAG)
      lasers. The Er:YAG laser can be used in implant bed preparation, as it brings no 
      thermal injury to the bone. The laser does not cause bone necrosis and positively
      affects osseointegration and the healing process. The use of the diode laser in
      soft tissue surgeries helps to obtain optimal hemostasis. Therefore, it can be
      used in implant exposure, since it allows performing immediate impressions. The
      present case report describes the implementation of the Er:YAG laser in the
      implant bed preparation of a single-tooth dental implant in position 35
      (according to the World Dental Federation (Federation Dentaire Internationale -
      FDI) notation) for better bone regeneration. The implant exposure was performed
      with the diode 980-nm laser for hemostasis and immediate impressions. The results
      of laser employment were compared to traditional drilling and scalpel techniques.
      The advantages and disadvantages of the application of the above lasers were
      featured.

TI  - A Novel Osteotomy Preparation Technique to Preserve Implant Site Viability and
      Enhance Osteogenesis.
LID - E170 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm8020170 [doi]
AB  - The preservation of bone viability at an osteotomy site is a critical variable
      for subsequent implant osseointegration. Recent biomechanical studies evaluating 
      the consequences of site preparation led us to rethink the design of bone-cutting
      drills, especially those intended for implant site preparation. We present here a
      novel drill design that is designed to efficiently cut bone at a very low
      rotational velocity, obviating the need for irrigation as a coolant. The
      low-speed cutting produces little heat and, consequently, osteocyte viability is 
      maintained. The lack of irrigation, coupled with the unique design of the cutting
      flutes, channels into the osteotomy autologous bone chips and osseous coagulum
      that have inherent osteogenic potential. Collectively, these features result in
      robust, new bone formation at rates significantly faster than those observed with
      conventional drilling protocols. These preclinical data have practical
      implications for the clinical preparation of osteotomies and alveolar bone
      reconstructive surgeries.

TI  - Ligature-Induced Peri-implant Bone Loss Around Loaded Zirconia and Titanium
      Implants.
PG  - 357-365
LID - 10.11607/jomi.7015 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To radiographically investigate ligature-induced peri-implant bone loss 
      around loaded titanium (Ti-SLA) and zirconia (ZrO2-ZLA) implants using a canine
      model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty sandblasted and acid-etched titanium and
      zirconia implants were alternately placed in the mandibles of five canines (20
      Ti-SLA, 20 ZrO2-ZLA). Implants were restored after 6 weeks of unloaded healing.
      After 4 weeks of functional loading, oral hygiene procedures were stopped and
      experimental peri-implant bone loss was initiated by placing cotton ligatures.
      After 8 weeks of active progression, ligatures were removed and plaque was
      allowed to accumulate for another 16 weeks of spontaneous progression (without
      ligatures). Standardized radiographs were taken at implant placement, at
      functional loading, and every 2 weeks during active and spontaneous progression
      of bone loss. RESULTS: Before ligature placement, all implants were successfully 
      osseointegrated and no clinical or radiographic signs of peri-implant infections 
      were detectable. Two weeks after ligature removal, one titanium implant was lost;
      however, no zirconia implant failures were observed during the study.
      Radiographically, zirconia implants revealed statistically significantly less
      crestal peri-implant bone loss compared to titanium implants at the end of the
      active progression period (Ti-SLA: 3.92 mm; ZrO2-ZLA: 2.65 mm; P < .01); however,
      no significant differences occurred after the spontaneous progression period (P =
      .6). Combining the active and spontaneous progression periods together, zirconia 
      implants demonstrated significantly reduced peri-implant bone loss compared to
      titanium implants (Ti-SLA: 3.76 mm; ZrO2-ZLA: 2.42 mm; P < .01). CONCLUSION:
      These results demonstrate a significantly reduced ligature-induced inflammation
      and bone loss for ZrO2-ZLA implants compared to Ti-SLA implants in the canine
      model.

TI  - Effects of micro/nano strontium-loaded surface implants on osseointegration in
      ovariectomized sheep.
PG  - 377-385
LID - 10.1111/cid.12719 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor osseointegration of dental implants often occurs in osteoporotic
      patients and processed implant surfaces could help to improve the dilemma.
      PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the effects of different titanium (Ti)
      surfaces on bone-implant osseointegration in ovariectomized (OVX) sheep.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups were included: smooth titanium (ST) was merely
      polished Ti; micro titanium (MT) was treated with hydrofluoric acid (HF) for 30
      minutes; strontium-loaded nano titanium (NT-Sr) was formed by magnetron
      sputtering; strontium-loaded micro/nano titanium (MNT-Sr) was fabricated by HF
      etching combined with magnetron sputtering. The biological responses were
      evaluated by human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs)
      experiments in vitro. Osseointegration was evaluated in vivo after each surface
      implant was inserted into OVX sheep' mandibles. RESULTS: The numbers of adhered
      and mineralized hBMMSCs increased significantly in the MNT-Sr group. The
      bone-implant contact and the maximal pull-out force increased significantly with 
      MNT-Sr surface. The bone volume ratio and trabecular number of the MNT-Sr group
      were significantly higher than others, whereas trabecular separation decreased.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that an MNT-Sr surface promotes the
      differentiation of hBMMSCs in vitro and enhances bone-implant osseointegration in
      vivo, which may be a promising option for clinical implants in osteoporotic
      patients.

TI  - 3-dimensional visualization of implant-tissue interface with the polyethylene
      glycol associated solvent system tissue clearing method.
PG  - e12578
LID - 10.1111/cpr.12578 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dental implants are major treatment options for restoring teeth loss.
      Biological processes at the implant-tissue interface are critical for implant
      osseointegration. Superior mechanical properties of the implant constitute a
      major challenge for traditional histological techniques. It is imperative to
      develop new technique to investigate the implant-tissue interface. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Our laboratory developed the polyethylene glycol (PEG)-associated
      solvent system (PEGASOS) tissue clearing method. By immersing samples into
      various chemical substances, bones and teeth could be turned to transparent with 
      intact internal structures and endogenous fluorescence being preserved. We
      combined the PEGASOS tissue clearing method with transgenic mouse line and other 
      labelling technique to investigate the angiogenesis and osteogenesis processes
      occurring at the implant-bone interface. RESULTS: Clearing treatment turned
      tissue highly transparent and implant could be directly visualized without
      sectioning. Implant, soft/hard tissues and fluorescent labels were simultaneously
      imaged in decalcified or non-decalcified mouse mandible samples without
      disturbing their interfaces. Multi-channel 3-dimensional image stacks at high
      resolution were acquired and quantified. The processes of angiogenesis and
      osteogenesis surrounding titanium or stainless steel implants were investigated. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Both titanium and stainless steel implants support angiogenesis at
      comparable levels. Successful osseointegration and calcium precipitation occurred
      only surrounding titanium, but not stainless steel implants. PEGASOS tissue
      clearing method provides a novel approach for investigating the interface between
      implants and hard tissue.

TI  - An In Vitro Study to Evaluate and Compare the Hemocompatibility of Titanium and
      Zirconia Implant Materials after Sandblasted and Acid-etched Surface Treatment.
PG  - 1448-1454
AB  - AIM: This study was aimed to investigate the hemocompatibility of zirconia and
      titanium implant materials after surface treatment with sandblasting and acid
      etching (SLA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty specimens were procured from
      manufacturers of dimension 10mm x 3mm, thirty of each were prefabricated medical 
      grade titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) and thirty of sintered zirconia. Silicon carbide grit 
      papers of 240 to 1200pm, was used to polish the specimen surface. The surfaces
      were rinsed with water to remove any remnant particles after polishing. Later
      ultrasonic cleaning was done for 5 minutes using distilled water. The control
      specimens included 15 specimens each from titanium (groups A1) and zirconia
      (groups B1). The remaining 15 specimens (groups A2 and B2) were sandblasted using
      alumina particles of 150 microns particle size and using 20% hydrochloric acid,
      acid etching was done for 30 seconds. The specimens were scanned under electron
      microscope after surface treatment for analysis purpose and evaluated for surface
      characteristics. Before the exposure of specimens to blood, percentage hemolysis,
      prothrombin, platelet aggregation and activation, and thrombin time values were
      calculated. one mL of blood was added to each specimen for testing. The values
      before and after the exposure of specimens to blood were noted. Using a t-test,
      the values noted were statistically Results: A1 (polished titanium) showed
      highest mean values after exposure, in platelet count (184.67 +/- 1.29),
      leucocyte count (7.27 +/- 0.08), and thrombin time (10.15 +/- 0.34) while
      prothrombin time's highest mean value after exposure were showed by A2 (SLA
      treated titanium) with a mean value of 10.04 +/- 0.24. CONCLUSION: Surface
      treatment with sandblasting and acid etching (SLA) using 150 microns alumina
      particles and 20% hydrochloric acid increased the surface roughness of the
      titanium and zirconia implant materials and polished titanium showed maximum
      hemocompatibility. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The implant's success depends on its
      biocompatibility and its property of osseointegration. The adverse interaction
      between blood and the artificial surface is detected by the hemocompatibility
      test for medical materials, to know if the surface can activate or destruct the
      blood components. The success of implant placement also depends on the
      interaction between the blood and the specimen.

TI  - Osseointegration of Superhydrophilic Implants Placed in Defect Grafted Bones.
PG  - 443-450
LID - 10.11607/jomi.7172 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Only limited information on the effect of implant surface hydrophilicity
      in conjunction with simultaneous bone augmentation is available. In this study,
      new bone growth around implants with a superhydrophilic modSLA (SLActive) and
      hydrophobic SLA (SLA) surface were compared in circumferential defects when
      grafted in conjunction with mineralized cancellous bone allograft (MCBA,
      maxgraft) or sintered bovine bone mineral (SBBM, cerabone). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The osseointegration and bone formation in circumferential defects in
      minipig mandibles around Straumann Roxolid, O 3.3 mm, length 8 mm; either SLA or 
      SLActive, were evaluated. Following implant placement, the 2-mm circumferential
      defects around the implants were filled with MCBA or SBBM. Distance from implant 
      shoulder to first bone-to-implant contact (f-BIC), percentage of bone-to-implant 
      contact (BIC), and bone aggregate percentage (amount of new bone and remaining
      graft) within the defect area were evaluated after 8 weeks of healing. RESULTS:
      In the SBBM group, lingual fBIC and buccal BIC were significantly lower for SLA
      (mean -0.404 +/- 0.579 mm for modSLA versus -1.191 +/- 0.814 mm for SLA, P = .021
      and mean 62.61% +/- 9.49% for modSLA versus 34.67% +/- 24.41% for SLA, P = .047, 
      respectively). Bone aggregate percentage was significantly higher for modSLA
      versus SLA implants in SBBM (77.84% +/- 6.93% versus 64.49% +/- 13.12%; P =
      .045). The differences between implant surfaces in MCBA showed a similar trend
      but were less pronounced than in the SBBM group and did not reach a statistically
      significant level. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that implants with a
      superhydrophilic modSLA surface are more conducive to faster osseointegration
      even in conjunction with simultaneous bone grafting procedures.

TI  - Immediately Loaded Fixed Full-Arch Implant-Retained Prosthesis: Clinical Analysis
      When Using a Moderate Insertion Torque.
PG  - 737-744
LID - 10.11607/jomi.7193 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study uses intentionally tilted implants with a moderate insertion 
      torque to retain an immediately loaded fixed full-arch implant-retained
      prosthesis using four implants. The aims of this study were to determine the
      likelihood that this type of implant-retained prosthesis can be predictably
      provided on the day of implant placement, the survival rate when providing
      immediate load, and the importance of insertion torque on the survival of the
      implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All implants that were placed after August 1,
      2015 and before December 31, 2016 at the ClearChoice Dental Implant Center of
      Minneapolis were recorded. The performance of these implants was followed to
      determine the success rate in the category of "intention to treat" where the
      treatment is provided on the same day as implant placement. Insertion torque was 
      recorded for all implants. Implants were followed to determine survival of the
      implants and complications observed. RESULTS: Between August 1, 2015 and December
      31, 2016, a total of 1,903 implants were placed. These implants were utilized to 
      support 441 prostheses, with 440 actually being restored with a provisional
      prosthesis on the day of implant placement. Mean follow-up time was 484 days with
      a maximum of 972 days and a median of 474 days. A total of 36 implants failed to 
      achieve osseointegration, resulting in an overall survival rate of 98.1% with a
      confidence interval (CI) of 98.7% to 97.5%. Survival was 97.6% in the maxilla and
      98.9% in the mandible. Insertion torque of less than 15 Ncm (n = 80, 77
      survival), between 15 and 34 Ncm (n = 122, 120 survival), and greater than 35 Ncm
      (n = 1,701, 1,670 survival) demonstrated no difference in implant survival.
      CONCLUSION: Based on this study of 1,903 implants placed between August 1, 2015
      and December 31, 2016, the following observations were made: (1) this
      surgical/prosthetic treatment approach succeeded in the "intention to treat"
      category with 440/441 (99.8%) prostheses inserted on the day of implant surgery; 
      (2) overall implant survival was 98.1%; (3) insertion torque appeared to have no 
      effect on implant survival.

TI  - Multidisciplinary oral rehabilitation in partially edentulous adult patients with
      malocclusion: A cross-sectional survey study.
PG  - e1177-e1183
LID - 10.4317/jced.55282 [doi]
AB  - Background: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to gather information
      regarding the opinion of Brazilian specialists in both orthodontics and
      implantology on multidisciplinary oral rehabilitation in partially edentulous
      patients with malocclusion. Material and Methods: A total of 305 specialists
      participated in a telephone survey and answered an ad hoc 10-item questionnaire, 
      including the request of total skull cone-beam tomographies (CBCT) and the use of
      3D digital planning software, the best moment of treatment to place dental
      implants, and the integration of orthodontics in implantology. Results: Most
      participants did not request CBCT (90.8%) or 3D digital planning software images 
      (92.3%) to diagnose and plan multidisciplinary oral rehabilitation. By contrast, 
      91.1% of participants would use an already dental implant as anchorage for
      orthodontics, 73.8% had already used implants for this purpose, 47.9% selected 4 
      months as the waiting time between implant placement and its use as anchorage,
      and 58.4% had already placed dental implants having in mind using them as
      anchorage for orthodontics and anticipating the oral rehabilitation process.
      Moreover, 93.4% of participants stated to avoid applying orthodontic forces in
      implants with unfavourable prognosis. A total of 67.9% of participants got the
      degree of specialist in Orthodontics before that of specialist in Implantology.
      The main reason for obtaining the other specialty degree was to be able to
      thoroughly exercise the two specialties. Conclusions: The use of technological
      advances, such as CBCT and 3D digital planning software was limited. Most dental 
      specialists would wait the osseointegration recommended time before applying
      orthodontic forces and thus using them as anchorage for orthodontics. The
      majority of interviewed dentists sought the other specialty to acquire
      multidisciplinary knowledge. Key words:Cross-sectional study, orthodontics,
      implantology, partially edentulous, malocclusion, oral rehabilitation.

TI  - Chemical Sympathectomy Impairs Peri-implant Osseointegration in Mice: Role of the
      Sympathetic Nervous System in Osseointegration.
PG  - 91-98
LID - 10.11607/jomi.7086 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The possibility that the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) controls bone 
      remodeling has been raised; however, the actual function of the SNS in
      osseointegration is still unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of 
      chemical sympathectomy on peri-implant osseointegration in adult mice. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Forty C57BL/6J mice (8-week-old) were divided into two groups: a
      sympathectomy group and a control group, which were administered
      6-hydroxydopamine and saline, respectively, by intraperitoneal injection for 5
      days. Then, the mice were exposed to implant surgery. Analyses of serum
      chemistry, microcomputed tomography, biomechanical test, and bone
      histomorphometry were employed at 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS: Compared with the
      control, the chemical sympathectomy group had a higher serum level of C-terminal 
      collagen I cross-links but lower serum osteocalcin. After 4 weeks, peri-implant
      trabecular microstructure, including trabecular volume, trabecular thickness, the
      percentage of osseointegration, and bone-to-implant contact, was lower; however, 
      the trabecular separation was higher in the sympathectomy group mice in
      comparison with the control group. In addition, the strength of bone-titanium
      integration measured by the biomechanical resistance test was lower. Furthermore,
      histomorphologic evidence revealed that the osteoclast counts were higher in the 
      sympathectomy group, while the mineral apposition rate and the bone formation
      rate per bone surface were significantly lower. CONCLUSION: Within the
      limitations of this experimental study, the data showed that chemical
      sympathectomy has a negative effect in peri-implant osseointegration, suggesting 
      that the SNS may need to be taken into consideration in terms of peri-implant
      bone healing.

AB  - Background: The use of dental implants as a prosthetic treatment modality for
      partially edentulous or completely edentulous patients is increased more commonly
      ever since the concept of osseointegration has been accepted. Objective: The
      objective of this study is to assess the awareness, knowledge, attitude, and
      acceptance of dental implants as a treatment modality among patients visiting SDM
      Dental College, Dharwad. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was
      conducted among 500 patients visiting SDM College of Dental Sciences and Hospital
      (SDMCDSH), Dharwad, using a self-explanatory questionnaire. Results: A total of
      500 individuals participated in the survey. The results of this survey indicate
      that 93.4% of the patients knew about dental implants, and for majority of them, 
      the major source of information was through their dentist followed by relatives
      and friends and electronic media. About 60.4% patients disapproved the removable 
      prosthesis as an option for the replacement of missing teeth. 77.2% patients
      expressed that they could not afford for the dental implant treatment. The major 
      deterioration for this treatment was related to the cost in 80.4% patients,
      surgical procedure in 11.6% patients, and a long treatment time in 5.6% patients.
      While 60.4% patients felt that dental implants being expensive, is the treatment 
      option only for the rich. Conclusion: The results of this survey showed that
      majority of the patients visiting SDMCDSH, Dharwad, were aware about dental
      implants as a treatment modality for the replacement of missing teeth. Although
      the attitude was positive and they did accept dental implants as a treatment
      option, the treatment cost mainly was the major reason to take a back step.

AB  - The permanent interaction between bone tissue and the immune system shows us the 
      complex biology of the tissue in which we insert oral implants. At the same time,
      new knowledge in relation to the interaction of materials and the host, reveals
      to us the true nature of osseointegration. So, to achieve clinical success or
      perhaps most importantly, to understand why we sometimes fail, the study of oral 
      implantology should consider the following advice equally important: a correct
      clinical protocol, the study of the immunomodulatory capacity of the device and
      the osteoimmunobiology of the host. Although osseointegration may seem adequate
      from the clinical point of view, a deeper vision shows us that a Foreign Body
      Equilibrium could be susceptible to environmental conditions. This is why
      maintaining this cellular balance should become our therapeutic target and, more 
      specifically, the understanding of the main cell involved, the macrophage. The
      advent of new information, the development of new implant surfaces and the
      introduction of new therapeutic proposals such as therapeutic
      mechanotransduction, will allow us to maintain a healthy host-implant
      relationship long-term.

AB  - Reconstruction of mandibular substance loss by a free flap is a widely used
      technique. This technique suffers from several disadvantages, including the
      presence of a second intervention site and a substantial frequency of
      complications. We have undertaken a custom-made 3-dimensional reconstruction
      (using computer-aided design and manufacturing) with prosthetic dental
      rehabilitation and esthetic improvement by lipomodeling of the face. A
      50-year-old woman presented with a massive recurrence of an ameloblastoma of the 
      right hemimandible. A cervical approach was used to resect the mandible well away
      from the tumor site. In light of her refusal to undergo reconstruction by a
      fibula free flap, reconstruction was performed using a custom-made porous
      titanium device with dental prosthetic rehabilitation, followed by lipomodeling
      of the face. The reconstruction was achieved without the occurrence of any
      complications. The implant-supported prosthetic dental implantation and the
      lipofilling resulted in functionally and esthetically satisfactory outcomes.
      Three-dimensional mandibular reconstruction with a custom-made porous titanium
      device and lipofilling yielded satisfactory results. Fitting of the dental
      prosthesis was undertaken at an early stage as it did not require
      osseointegration, although there was a need to overcome difficulties linked with 
      the seal and the stability of the dental prosthesis and titanium support. The
      duration of patient follow-up was 18 months.

TI  - Mussel-Inspired Polydopamine Coating: A General Strategy To Enhance Osteogenic
      Differentiation and Osseointegration for Diverse Implants.
PG  - 7615-7625
LID - 10.1021/acsami.8b21558 [doi]
AB  - Surface modifications play an important role in endowing implant surface with
      excellent biocompatibility and bioactivity. Among the bioinspired surface
      modifications, the mussel-inspired polydopamine (PDA) has aroused great interest 
      of researchers. Herein, we fabricated PDA on diverse implant surfaces, including 
      biopolymer, biometal, and bioceramic. Then the effects of PDA coating on cell
      responsive behaviors in vitro and bone formation capacity in vivo were evaluated 
      in detail. The results showed that PDA coating was fabricated on diverse samples 
      surface successfully, which could significantly improve the hydrophilicity of
      different material surfaces. Furthermore, the results indicated that PDA coating 
      exerted direct enhancing on the adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic
      differentiation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) through 
      FAK and p38 signaling pathways. During the process, the focal adhesion protein
      expression and osteogenic-related genes expression level (e.g., ALP, BMP2, BSP,
      and OPN) were considerably upregulated. Most importantly, the in vivo study
      confirmed that PDA coating remarkably accelerated new bone formation and enhanced
      osseointegration performance. Our study uncovered the biological responses
      stimulated by PDA coating to make a better understanding of cell/tissue-PDA
      interactions and affirmed that PDA, a bioinspired polymer, has great potential as
      a candidate and functional bioactive coating medium in bone regeneration and
      orthopedic application.

TI  - A Novel Approach for Horizontal Augmentation of Posterior Maxilla Using Ridge
      Split Technique.
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000005124 [doi]
AB  - Over the years, there have been a series of innovative approaches to the alveolar
      bone augmentation techniques. These have led to the modifications of the existing
      methods and the establishment of more efficient ways to obtain sufficient bone
      mass that is necessary for the implant procedure. The aim of this paper is to
      propose a novel augmentation technique, and to investigate its efficacy,
      particularly during the healing process of the maxillary alveolar bone prior to
      the implant treatment. During the application of the proposed methodology, first,
      the ridge-split technique was applied to the posterior maxilla. Then, a
      horizontal augmentation procedure was performed with an autogenous bone graft.
      Implants were placed at the second month of the surgery. Prosthetic
      rehabilitation was completed after the osseointegration of the implants. The
      technique was compared with the ridge-split method with simultaneous implant
      placement in 14 patients. The groups were divided into 2, the control group and
      the experimental group, each containing 7 patients. The aimed success criteria
      for the status of the endosteal implants were fulfilled and there were not any
      complications observed in the second year of follow-up.The basic practical
      innovation offered by the proposed surgical technique is to achieve the required 
      horizontal dimension and to change the quality of the bone conveniently. The
      press-fit insertion leads to multipoint contact healing of the transported bone
      and the use of cortical block bone in posterior maxilla, led to a significantly
      advantageous higher stability level for both the placement and the survival of
      the implants.

AB  - PURPOSE: Primary implant stability is crucial to osseointegration. The aim of
      this study was to assess correlation of preoperative radiologic parameters with
      intraoperatively obtained biomechanical tests in the maxilla. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A total of 259 implants were inserted in the maxilla of 99 patients.
      Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-derived Hounsfield units (HU), voxel grey
      values and computed tomography mental index (CTMI) performed preoperatively were 
      correlated with insertion torque and Periotest (obtained intraoperatively and 12 
      weeks later) to assess their prognostic value for primary implant stability.
      RESULTS: Voxel grey values and insertion torque showed a low correlation (r =
      0.329, p = 1.055x10(-7) ). Likewise, a low correlation was found between HU
      measured preoperatively and insertion torque as well as intraoperative Periotest 
      values (r = 0.297, p = 4x10(-6) and r = - 0.234, p = 4.35x10(-4), respectively). 
      A moderate correlation could, however, be assessed between insertion torque and
      intraoperative as well as Periotest values 12 weeks later. (r = -0.555, p =
      1.022x10(-20) and -0.465. p = 1.150x10(-13)). On contrast, a high correlation was
      observed between the voxel grey values of CBCT and related HU (r = 0.710, p =
      6.486x10(-37) ) so that a conversion from grey values into HU could be suggested.
      According to regression analysis, an intraoperative negative Periotest value
      could be expected at an insertion torque of 40 N/cm upwards. CONCLUSION:
      CBCT-based bone density parameters correlate with each other and allow conversion
      of grey scales into HU preoperatively. Both insertion torque and Periotest showed
      a significant correlation which enables regression analysis to predict implant
      stability for related insertion torque. On contrast, for HU the distribution
      curves do not allow a reliable assignment into certain Periotest values.

PG  - 477-481
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the osseointegration of domestic porous
      tantalum-niobium(PTa-Nb) alloy. METHODS: A total of 36 adult New Zealand rabbits 
      were selected and divided into 3 groups. Pta-Nb rods(3.5 mmx10 mm) were implanted
      into the femoral condyle of each rabbit.The rabbits were sacrificed successively 
      at 4,8,12 weeks after operation. X-ray, hard tissue slices stained with toluidine
      blue, scanning electron microscope(SEM), X-ray energy disperse spectroscopy(XEDS)
      and push-out test were used to test the osseointegration of PTa-Nb. SPSS19.0
      software package was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: X-ray films showed
      no obvious inflammation,as well as implants loosing and bone resorption. Density 
      of the bone around implants increased. Hard tissue slices displayed chimeric
      shape in the implant-bone interface. New bone contacted directly to the surface
      of PTa-Nb and got more and more closer with the increase of healing time. Osteoid
      formed in the inner pores at 4 weeks after operation,and more mature bone tissue 
      grew into inner part of PTa-Nb at 12 weeks. SEM showed bone tissue was more
      denser and closer to the Pta-Nb,which was similar to the results of hard tissue
      slices. XEDS analysis showed the percent content of the calcium and phosphate of 
      the tissue within PTa-Nb increased gradually in the three groups.The ratio of
      Ca/P at 8 and 12 weeks was significantly higher than at 4 weeks (P<0.05);
      Push-out test showed the shear-strength of PTa-Nb implants increased from
      (8.26+/-0.75) MPa at 4 weeks to (21.04+/-1.46) MPa at 12 weeks (P<0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: The domestic PTa-Nb alloy has good osseointegration with both bone
      tissue ongrowth and ingrowth,which may be a high potential biomimetic bone
      material.

AB  - Patients with cancer have recently been treated with more advanced targeted
      chemotherapies that have greater specificity towards the cancer cells and fewer
      side effects. However, the periods of treatment take longer than those of
      traditional cytotoxic treatments. The aim of this study was to examine the effect
      of antiangiogenic targeted chemotherapy on the osseointegration of titanium
      implants. Fourteen white New Zealand rabbits were allocated randomly into two
      groups of seven: the placebo control group and the Avastin((R)) group. Animals in
      the Avastin((R)) group had five doses of bevacizumab intraperitoneally
      (3mg/kg/week). The first was given two days before the implant was inserted and
      the remaining four were given weekly for four weeks. One titanium implant was
      inserted in the right distal femoral condyle of each rabbit. Osseointegration of 
      the implants was measured using microcomputed tomography (CT) and
      histomorphometric evaluation. Both of these showed less osseointegration in the
      Avastin((R)) group than in the controls. The pharmacological inhibition of
      angiogenesis by bevacizumab may negatively affect the osseointegration of
      titanium implants in rabbits.

TI  - A Quantitative Approach for the Bone-implant Osseointegration Assessment Based on
      Ultrasonic Elastic Guided Waves.
LID - E454 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s19030454 [doi]
AB  - Quantitative and reliable monitoring of osseointegration will help further
      evaluate the integrity of the orthopaedic construct to promote novel prosthesis
      design and allow early mobilisation. Quantitative assessment of the degree or the
      lack of osseointegration is important for the clinical management with the
      introduction of prosthetic implants to amputees. Acousto-ultrasonic wave
      propagation has been used in structural health monitoring as well as human health
      monitoring but so far has not extended to osseointegrated implants or prostheses.
      This paper presents an ultrasonic guided wave approach to assess the
      osseointegration of a novel implant. This study explores the potential of
      integrating structural health monitoring concepts into a new osseointegrated
      implant. The aim is to demonstrate the extension of acousto-ultrasonic
      techniques, which have been widely reported for the structural health monitoring 
      of engineering structures, to assess the state of osseointegration of a bone and 
      implant. To illustrate this potential, this paper will report on the experimental
      findings which investigated the unification of an aluminium implant and bone-like
      geometry surrogate. The core of the test specimen is filled with silicone and
      wrapped with plasticine to simulate the highly damped cancellous bone and soft
      tissue, respectively. To simulate the osseointegration process, a 2-h adhesive
      epoxy is used to bond the surrogate implant and a bone-like structure. A series
      of piezoelectric elements are bonded onto the surrogate implant to serve as
      actuators and sensors. The actuating piezoelectric element on an extramedullary
      strut is excited with a 1 MHz pulse signal. The reception of the ultrasonic wave 
      by the sensing elements located on the adjacent and furthest struts is used to
      assess the integration of this implant to the parent bone structure. The study
      shows an Osseointegration Index can be formulated by using engineering and
      acousto-ultrasonic methods to measure the unification of a bone and implant. This
      also highlights a potential quantitative evaluation technique regardless of
      bone-implant geometry and soft tissue damping.

      extremity: surgical technique.
PG  - 34-39
LID - 10.1016/j.jses.2017.12.006 [doi]
AB  - Background: Reconstruction of large segments of bone loss can be very difficult. 
      The use of a prestressed ingrowth implant can offer an attractive surgical option
      in these challenging cases. Methods: This report describes the surgical technique
      in depth, combining the experience of the authors. Nuances of the technique are
      emphasized. Results: Although published reports are uncommon, long-term
      restoration of extremity function is possible with this technology. Conclusions: 
      The use of compressive osseointegration endoprostheses is not yet widespread in
      the upper extremity, but this technology adds to the host of surgical options for
      managing massive bone loss and difficult revision surgery.

TI  - Long-Term Prevention of Bacterial Infection and Enhanced Osteoinductivity of a
      Hybrid Coating with Selective Silver Toxicity.
PG  - e1801465
LID - 10.1002/adhm.201801465 [doi]
AB  - Antibacterial and osteogenic design is required for ideal orthopedic implants.
      The excellent antimicrobial performance of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has
      attracted interest for the treatment of implant-related infections. However, the 
      dose-dependent cytotoxicity of silver and its negative impact on bone implants
      restrict the further use of AgNPs coatings. Therefore, a hybrid coating
      containing polydopamine (PDA), hydroxyapatite (HA), AgNPs, and chitosan (CS) is
      prepared. Organic chelators CS and PDA that have promising biocompatibility are
      used to prevent the rapid release of silver ions from the AgNPs coating. The
      double chelating effect of PDA and CS significantly reduces silver ion release
      from the hybrid coating. The coating exhibits excellent anti-biofilm efficiency
      of 91.7%, 89.5%, and 92.0% for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,
      and Escherichia coli, respectively. In addition, the coating can significantly
      stimulate osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and promote bone-implant
      osseointegration in vivo as compared to that in the control group. The
      longitudinal biosafety of the coating is confirmed in vivo by histological
      evaluation and blood tests. The results of this study indicate that the hybrid
      coating exhibits antibacterial properties as well as allow bone-implant
      osseointegration, thereby providing insight into the design of multifunctional
      implants for long-term orthopedic applications.

TI  - Functionalization of titanium substrate with multifunctional peptide OGP-NAC for 
      the regulation of osteoimmunology.
PG  - 1463-1476
LID - 10.1039/c8bm01611a [doi]
AB  - The immune response to an orthopedic implant is closely related to the nearby
      bone metabolism balance. To modify titanium (Ti) substrates and accordingly
      regulate the balance between osteoclast activation and osteoblast
      differentiation, a multifunctional peptide OGP-NAC was synthesized via
      conjugating an osteogenic growth peptide (OGP) with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Then,
      the synthesized peptide was employed to functionalize Ti substrates and the
      response of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts was investigated in vitro. The
      results showed that OGP-NAC was successfully prepared and immobilized onto Ti
      substrate surfaces. Thereafter, studies on introducing RAW 264.7 cells (one kind 
      of monocyte macrophage responsible for immune responses) to osteoclasts
      demonstrated that the peptide modified Ti surface could inhibit RAW 264.7 cells
      from secreting important inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta), and
      suppress the activation of MAPK, NF-kappaB and NFAT c1, which are important
      transcription factors for osteoclastogenesis. Meanwhile, the modified surface
      promoted osteoblast spreading, proliferation and differentiation. The study
      offers a feasible strategy to mediate the balance between osteoclast activation
      and osteoblast differentiation, having great potential for improving
      osseointegration of an orthopedic implant.

TI  - Changes in proinflammatory gene expression in human whole blood after contact
      with UV-conditioned implant surfaces.
LID - 10.1007/s00784-019-02801-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vitro study was to assess changes in the gene
      expression of proinflammatory cytokines in human whole blood after contact with
      titanium implant surfaces conditioned by UV light. To this end, expression levels
      of proinflammatory cytokines were analyzed in vitro in human whole blood.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dental implants made of grade 4 titanium were conditioned 
      by UV light in a UV device and submerged in human whole blood. Unconditioned
      implants served as controls, and blood samples without implants served as the
      negative control group. Sampling was performed at 1, 8, and 24 h. Changes in the 
      expression levels of interleukin-1beta (IL1B) and tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF) were assessed using RT-qPCR at the mRNA level. RESULTS: The gene expression
      of IL1B was significantly suppressed in the test group over the observation
      period compared to the control group during the 1-8 h after having contact
      between the implant surface and the blood. The gene expression of TNF was not
      significantly altered by UV conditioning after 1 and 8 h of observation, but both
      cytokine expression levels were increased significantly after 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Differences in the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines after insertion
      of UV-conditioned titanium implants can be assessed using a human whole blood
      test. UV-conditioned implant surfaces apparently suppress the release of IL1B in 
      vitro. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results of our publication demonstrate that
      modulation of the early inflammatory response in human whole blood is possible by
      surface treatment with UV light. In particular, the suppression of IL1B
      expression, especially after the initial contact of blood cells, may be
      beneficial in the osseointegration of titanium implants by positively influence
      the balance between rejection and acceptance of an implant.

AB  - Background: Implant-related infection is a major problem postsurgery. As an
      alternative to a localized antibiotic release system, we used Ag to fabricate
      Ti-Ag alloys with nanotubular coatings (TiAg-NTs). Ag has excellent antibacterial
      properties, but its biological toxicity is a concern. Therefore, we performed
      biological experiments both in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the biocompatibility
      of TiAg-NTs with different concentrations of Ag (1%, 2%, and 4%). Methods: For in
      vitro experiments, cytocompatibility, including cell attachment, viability, and
      proliferation, was tested, and genes and proteins related to osteogenic
      differentiation were also evaluated. For in vivo assays, the rat femoral condylar
      insertion model was used, and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and
      histological analysis were conducted to analyze bone formation around implants at
      1, 2, and 4 weeks after surgery. Results: Both in vitro and in vivo results
      indicate that Ti2%Ag-NT showed comparable cytocompatibility with commercially
      pure Ti (cp-Ti), and it could achieve good osseointegration with the surrounding 
      bone tissue. Conclusion: We thus believe that Ti2%Ag-NT is a potential
      biomaterial for orthopedics.

AB  - PURPOSE: Successful implant therapy is based on fast, safe, and predictable
      osseointegration. Several surface modifications have been introduced to improve
      the bone-to-implant interaction. This in vivo study evaluates the impact of
      plasma surface conditioning on early wound healing and osseointegration.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 16 dental implants with a sand-blasted and
      acid-etched surface were conditioned with cold atmospheric plasma prior to
      insertion in the frontal bone of four miniature pigs. Sequential fluorescence
      labeling was administered to label bone metabolism, and after 8 weeks, bone
      blocks were harvested for radiological, histological, and histomorphometrical
      evaluation. RESULTS: The plasma conditioning had no impact on the morphology of
      the implant surface. The bone-to-implant contact ratio was 90.4% and 86.5%, the
      interthread bone density 72.5% and 63.4%, and the periimplant bone density 60.5% 
      and 61.1%, in the plasma conditioned group and control group, respectively.
      Concentric bands of fluorescence enrichment indicated a chronological and
      homogenous mineralization of newly formed bone. No unwanted periimplant side
      effects were detected. CONCLUSION: The increased parameters for osseointegration 
      in this in vivo study merit further investigation in prospective clinical trials.

AB  - To address periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), a formidable complication after 
      joint arthroplasty, an implant with excellent osseointegration and effective
      antibacterial activity has being extensively pursued and developed. In this work,
      the mouse beta-defensin-14 (MBD-14) was immobilized on the polyetheretherketone
      (PEEK) surface with three-dimensional (3D) porous structure to improve its
      antibacterial activity and osseointegration. An in vitro antibacterial evaluation
      showed that the porous PEEK loaded with MBD-14 wages a durable and effective
      fight against both Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive) and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa (gram-negative). In addition to the superior antibacterial activity,
      we found that the enhanced proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone
      mesenchymal stem cells were verified through various in vitro analyses. To
      evaluate the in vivo bactericidal effect and osseointegration of the samples, the
      rat femoral models with infection and non-infection were established. The
      enhanced osseointegration of the MBD-14-loaded samples was found in both two in
      vivo models. And no bacteria survived on the surfaces of samples with a
      relatively high MBD-14 concentration. Above results indicate that the 3D porous
      PEEK coating loaded with MBD-14 simultaneously yields excellent osseointegration 
      while exerting durable and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. And it paves
      the way for PEEK to be applied clinically to address PJI. STATEMENT OF
      SIGNIFICANCE: (1). By using the physio-chemical technique including sulfonation
      and lyophilization etc., a three-dimensional porous network is developed on
      polyetheretherketone (PEEK) surface, in which mouse beta-defensin-14 (MBD-14, a
      broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide) is then loaded. It endows PEEK with
      antibacterial activity and osseointegration. (2). Two in vivo animal models with 
      infection and non-infection are used to prove the new bone formation around the
      samples. (3). Supplementary material also proves that MBD-14 promotes the
      osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. However, its potential mechanism needs to be
      further studied in future. (4). The modified PEEK, including excellent
      osseointegration and a durable and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, could
      be applied clinically to address PJI which is a hot potato for surgeons and
      patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty.

AB  - Limb salvage is widely practiced as standard of care in most cases of extremity
      bone sarcoma. Allograft and endoprosthesis reconstructions are the most widely
      utilized modalities for the reconstruction of large segment defects, however
      complication rates remain high. Aseptic loosening and infection remain the most
      common modes of failure. Implant integration, soft-tissue function, and infection
      prevention are crucial for implant longevity and function. Macro and micro
      alterations in implant design are reviewed in this manuscript. Tissue engineering
      principles using nanoparticles, cell-based, and biological augments have been
      utilized to develop implant coatings that improve osseointegration and decrease
      infection. Similar techniques have been used to improve the interaction between
      soft tissues and implants. Tissue engineered constructs (TEC) used in combination
      with, or in place of, traditional reconstructive techniques may represent the
      next major advancement in orthopaedic oncology reconstructive science, although
      preclinical results have yet to achieve durable translation to the bedside.

      maxillary overdentures on four bar- and six bar-connected implants placed in the 
      posterior region during a 5-year follow-up period. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Sixty-six fully edentulous patients with functional maxillary denture complaints 
      and insufficient bone volume to allow implant placement were scheduled for a
      maxillary sinus floor elevation procedure with bone from the anterior iliac crest
      and randomized to receive either four or six implants in the posterior maxilla
      and four implants in the mandible. After 3 months of osseointegration, a
      bar-supported overdenture was constructed. Maxillary implant survival,
      overdenture survival, clinical scores, peri-implant bone height changes and
      patient satisfaction were assessed. RESULTS: Sixty patients completed the 5-year 
      follow-up. Implant survival was 100% in the four-implant group and 99.5% in the
      six-implant group. No new overdentures had to be made in the four-implant group, 
      and three new overdentures were made in the six-implant group due to excessive
      wear of the denture base and teeth (90.9% overdenture survival). Clinical
      parameters did not differ significantly between groups. Mean marginal bone loss
      compared to baseline was 0.58 +/- 0.51 mm in the four-implant group and 0.60 +/- 
      0.58 mm in the six-implant group, respectively. Overall, patient satisfaction
      improved significantly, but did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: Following 
      a bilateral maxillary sinus floor elevation procedure, a bar-supported
      overdenture on four implants in the posterior maxillary region is not inferior to
      an overdenture supported by six implants after a 5-year evaluation period in
      patients with functional maxillary denture complaints and marked posterior
      resorption (Clinical trial registration number: NTR2969).

TI  - Bone response to porous tantalum implants in a gap-healing model.
PG  - 156-168
LID - 10.1111/clr.13402 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the relative osteogenic 
      behavior of titanium implants with or without a porous tantalum modification when
      placed with a gap between the implant and existing bone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      gap-healing model in the rabbit tibia was used for placement of titanium
      implants. Forty-eight rabbits received 96 implants, with 48 of the implants
      containing a porous tantalum middle section and the remaining 48 implants were
      composed of solid titanium. After 4, 8, and 12 weeks of healing, biomechanical
      stability was measured with removal torque testing, implant-adherent cells were
      isolated for analysis of osteogenic gene expression, and histomorphometric
      analysis was performed on sections of the implants and surrounding bone. RESULTS:
      Increased osteogenic activity at 4 weeks was demonstrated by upregulation of key 
      osteogenic genes at implants containing porous tantalum which was accompanied by 
      greater bone-implant contact at 4, 8, and 12 weeks and significantly greater
      removal torque at 8 and 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Implants containing porous
      tantalum demonstrated increased peri-implant bone formation within this
      gap-healing model as shown by significant differences in biomechanical and
      histomorphometric outcomes. Such implants may represent an alternative to
      influence bone healing in surgical sites with an existing gap.

TI  - Macrophage polarization in aseptic bone resorption around dental implants induced
      by Ti particles in a murine model.
LID - 10.1111/jre.12633 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Titanium particles/ions detected in peri-implant
      tissues have been considered as a potential etiologic factor for crestal bone
      loss around oral implants. However, the definite impact of titanium wear
      particles on the health of surrounding structures remains undetermined. The
      purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of titanium
      particles-induced foreign body reaction on peri-implant bone level and the
      related mechanism by using clodronate liposomes to deplete macrophages. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats with custom-made titanium screw implanted in
      bilateral maxillary first molar area for 4 weeks to obtain osseointegration were 
      randomly divided into four groups. Twenty microgram titanium particles were
      introduced into the peri-implant tissue to induce aseptic foreign body reaction, 
      and macrophages were depleted by the local injection of 100 muL clodronate
      liposome immediately and re-injection every 3 days until the sacrifice of the
      rats (Ti + LipClod group). Titanium-injected rats also treated with phosphate
      buffer solution (Ti + PBS) or empty liposome (Ti + Lip) as well as rats injected 
      with PBS alone (Control) were included as controls. Eight weeks later, animals
      were sacrificed and samples containing implants were collected. Half of the
      samples were analyzed radiologically to measure bone level change, and macrophage
      markers (CD68, CCR7, CD163) was also characterized by immunofluorescence to
      evaluate macrophage number, density, and phenotype distribution
      (CCR7+M1/CD163+M2). The rest of the samples were used to determine the relative
      mRNA expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and RANKL with real-time PCR
      analysis. RESULTS: No obvious bacterial contamination was found in all
      titanium-injected areas, and the implant survival rate was 100% with no implant
      loss. Compared with Ti + PBS and Ti + Lip group, macrophage density (1.64 +/-
      0.86%) infiltrated into peri-implant tissue and bone loss (0.17 +/- 0.03 mm)
      around implant decreased significantly in the Ti + LipClod group.
      Immunofluorescence analysis showed that more macrophage infiltrated into
      peri-implant tissue in the Ti + PBS and Ti + Lip groups, predominantly with M1
      phenotype. In contrast, the macrophage density was lower and M2 phenotype was
      dominant in the Control group, while macrophages density was significantly
      reduced and the M1 type macrophages were slightly more than M2 type in the Ti +
      LipClod group. Accordingly, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL6, and RANKL mRNA expression
      increased significantly in the Ti + PBS and Ti + Lip groups compared with Control
      and Ti + LipClod groups. CONCLUSIONS: Titanium particles had a negative effect on
      peri-implant tissue by activating macrophages which induced an M1 macrophage
      phenotype promoting local secretion of inflammatory cytokines. It was found that 
      clodronate liposome treatment attenuated the severity of inflammation and bone
      loss by depletion of macrophages. Therefore, the present study revealed the
      marked impact of macrophage polarization with respect to peri-implant bone loss
      caused by titanium particles.

TI  - Effect of the Wnt signal-RANKL/OPG axis on the enhanced osteogenic integration of
      a lithium incorporated surface.
PG  - 1101-1116
LID - 10.1039/c8bm01411f [doi]
AB  - Bone remolding involves the formation of new bone by osteoblasts and the
      absorption of old bones by osteoclasts. Due to the vital role of osteoblasts and 
      osteoclasts during bone regeneration, it might be feasible to promote
      osseointegration around the titanium implants by stimulating osteoblasts and
      inhibiting osteoclasts by modifying the surfaces of the implants. Lithium is used
      in the treatment of psychiatric patients, and it may be associated with
      osteogenesis. In this study, lithium was incorporated with sandblasted,
      large-grit and acid-etched titanium implants via a hydrothermal treatment. In
      vitro, the nano-scale surface enhanced the adhesion and proliferation of bone
      marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Moreover, the SLA-Li surface displayed a
      negative effect on the process of osteoclastogenesis. Further mechanism analysis 
      indicated that the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was activated
      according to the results of RT-PCR and western blotting. More importantly, the
      RANKL/OPG signaling axis was also involved in these effects on the SLA-Li
      surface. The experiments in vivo proved that the SLA-Li surface could induce the 
      bone formation and osseointegration during the early osseointegration after the
      dental implant surgery. These results suggested that bone homeostasis could be
      manipulated by an SLA-Li surface, which implied that this new surface might serve
      as a promising material for clinical application in the future.

AB  - Objective: To explore the osteogenic activity of Zn/Ca/P-containing coatings on
      titanium implant surface modified by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO).
      Methods: Three groups implants including Zn/Ca/P-containing surface treated by
      PEO in experimental groups and Ca/P-containing and TiO(2) sandblasted surface in 
      control group were randomly inserted in the bilateral mandibular of rabbits.
      Mechanical testing and implant-bone interface observation were performed at 4, 6,
      8, 10 and 12 weeks after implantion. Results: Zn/Ca/P-containing coating
      presented a microporous structure. The push-out value indicated the statistical
      differences among the three groups at each observed time point (P<0.05), and
      implant-bone bonding power reached a maximum value at 12 weeks, those in the
      Zn/Ca/P-containing group [(1.57+/-0.26) MPa] was higher than those in the group
      with sandblasted surface [(0.83+/-0.24) MPa] (P<0.05). Histological examination
      and implant-bone interface observation using field scaning electron microscope
      (FSEM) showed that the new bone of implant-bone interface increased with healing 
      time and the result from Zn/Ca/P-containing group was superior to that from the
      control groups at each observed time point. Conclusions: Zn/Ca/P-containing
      coatings by PEO can accelerate bone formation and remodeling, and enhance
      bone-implant bonding force.

TI  - Combination Use of BMP2 and VEGF165 Promotes Osseointegration and Stability of
      Titanium Implants in Irradiated Bone.
PG  - 8139424
LID - 10.1155/2018/8139424 [doi]
AB  - Background: Clinical data demonstrated that failure rate of titanium implant in
      irradiated bone was 2-3 times higher than that in nonirradiated bone and it is
      difficult to get the ideal results in irradiated bone. Purpose: The aim of the
      study was to investigate the effects of HBO, BMP2, VEGF165, and combined use of
      BMP2/VEGF165 on osseointegration and stability of titanium implant in irradiated 
      bone. Materials and Methods: Sixty rabbits were randomly assigned to 5 groups
      (control group, HBO group, VEGF165 group, BMP2 group, and BMP2/VEGF165 group)
      after receiving 15 Gy radiation. Implant surgery was performed on tibias eight
      weeks later. They were sacrificed at two or eight weeks after operation. Implant 
      stability, calcium, and ALP activity in serum, the ratio of bone volume to total 
      volume, the rate of bone growth, and gene expression were assessed. Result: There
      was no mortality and no implants failed during the experiment. Implant stability 
      was significantly compromised in the control group compared to the other four
      experimental groups, and the BMP2/VEGF165 group had the highest implant
      stability. HBO, BMP2, and VEGF165 significantly increased BV/TV and the rate of
      bone growth, while the BMP2/VEGF165 showed the best effect among groups. The
      expression of RUNX2 in HBO, BMP2, and VEGF165/BMP2 group was higher than that in 
      the VEGF165 and control groups at two weeks. The expression of OCN in HBO, BMP2, 
      VEGF165, and VEGF165/BMP2 groups was higher than that in the control group, and
      the gene expression of CD31 was higher in HBO, VEGF165, and BMP2/VEGF165 groups
      than that in control and BMP2 groups. Conclusion: HBO, BMP2, and VEGF165 could
      increase bone formation around the implant and improved the implant stability in 
      irradiated bone. The combination use of BMP2 and VEGF165 may be promising in the 
      treatment of implant patients with radiotherapy.

TI  - Relationship between cortical bone thickness and implant stability at the time of
      surgery and secondary stability after osseointegration measured using resonance

AB  - Purpose: It has been suggested that resonance frequency analysis (RFA) can
      measure changes in the stability of dental implants during osseointegration. This
      retrospective study aimed to evaluate dental implant stability at the time of
      surgery (primary stability; PS) and secondary stability (SS) after
      ossseointegration using RFA, and to investigate the relationship between implant 
      stability and cortical bone thickness. Methods: In total, 113 patients who
      attended the Tohoku University Hospital Dental Implant Center were included in
      this study. A total of 229 implants were placed in either the mandibular region
      (n=118) or the maxilla region (n=111), with bone augmentation procedures used in 
      some cases. RFA was performed in 3 directions, and the lowest value was recorded.
      The preoperative thickness of cortical bone at the site of implant insertion was 
      measured digitally using computed tomography, excluding cases of bone grafts and 
      immediate implant placements. Results: The mean implant stability quotient (ISQ) 
      was 69.34+/-9.43 for PS and 75.99+/-6.23 for SS. The mandibular group had
      significantly higher mean ISQ values than the maxillary group for both PS and SS 
      (P<0.01). A significant difference was found in the mean ISQ values for PS
      between 1-stage and 2-stage surgery (P<0.5). The mean ISQ values in the
      non-augmentation group were higher than in the augmentation group for both PS and
      SS (P<0.01). A weak positive correlation was observed between cortical bone
      thickness and implant stability for both PS and SS in all cases (P<0.01).
      Conclusions: Based on the present study, the ISQ may be affected by implant
      position site, the use of a bone graft, and cortical bone thickness before
      implant therapy.

AB  - Osseointegrated auditory devices (OADs) are hearing devices that use an external 
      receiver/processor that stimulates bone conduction of sound via a titanium
      prosthesis that is drilled into the bone of the cranium. Since their introduction
      in 1977, OADs have undergone substantial evolution, including changes in
      manufacturing of the implant, improvements in the external sound processor, and
      simplification of implantation techniques. Expansion of criteria for patient
      candidacy for implantation has occurred corresponding with changes in the
      implants and processors.

TI  - Biological Response to Recombinant Human Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 on
      Bone-Implant Osseointegration in Ovariectomized Experimental Design.
PG  - 141-144
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000004992 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of recombinant
      human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) on bone-implant osteointegration in 
      osteoporotic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six female Wistar rats were
      randomly divided into 3 groups: sham-operation (SHAM), ovariectomized (OVX), and 
      ovariectomized with rhBMP-2 (OVX + rhBMP-2). The bone density of right tibia was 
      observed with x-ray and the serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was
      measured preovariectomy and postovariectomy using an ALP-kit. In OVX + rhBMP-2
      group, rhBMP-2 was embedded in the peri-implant area, while SHAM and OVX groups
      did not contain rhBMP-2. Four and eight weeks after implantation, the rats were
      killed and the right tibia with implants was taken by x-ray. Histologic changes
      were investigated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, scanning electron microscope
      (SEM), and energy dispersive spectrometer examinations. RESULTS: The serum ALP
      level was significantly higher in ovariectomized rats compared with that before
      ovariectomy (P < 0.05), while no difference was found in SHAM rats. At 12 weeks
      after ovariectomy, radiographic and histologic findings showed significant
      osteoporotic changes in proximal tibial metaphyses of OVX rats, including reduced
      cortical bone density and enlargement of bone marrow cavity compared with SHAM
      ones. The results of implantation verified new bone formation around implants in 
      OVX + rhBMP-2 and SHAM groups, indicating favorable bone healing and
      osseointegration. No bone resorption was found in OVX + rhBMP-2 group, while some
      soft tissue was observed in bone-implant interface in SHAM group. In OVX group,
      there was no effective bone-implant osseointegration and mature bone formed
      around implants, and some implants were even lost due to chronic inflammation.
      The percentage of calcium and phosphorous atoms was significantly higher and the 
      percentage of sulfur element was significantly lower in peri-implant area in OVX 
      + rhBMP-2 and SHAM groups than that in OVX group. CONCLUSION: rhBMP-2 could
      enhance the osseous healing and restore bone-implant osseointegration in
      osteoporotic rats.

AB  - Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) has been demonstrated to be an effective
      surface treatment for enhancing the osteoconduction and osseointegration of
      commercially pure alpha-Ti (CP alpha-Ti) dental implant materials for clinical
      application. To explore the feasibility of extending the application of PEO to
      low-modulus beta-type titanium alloys for load-bearing orthopaedic implants, a
      thorough understanding of the effect of substrate material on the biological
      performance of the PEO-treated surface is required. A 10 kW 50 Hz KeroniteTM
      processing unit was used to modify the surface of low-modulus near
      beta-Ti13Nb13Zr and beta-Ti45Nb substrates. CP alpha-Ti and (alpha +
      beta)-Ti6Al4V were also used in parallel as reference materials. In vitro culture
      of foetal human osteoblast (fHOb) cells on PEO-treated low-modulus near
      beta-Ti13Nb13Zr and beta-Ti45Nb alloys revealed comparable behaviour to that seen
      with CP alpha-Ti and (alpha + beta)-Ti6Al4V with respect to metabolic activity,
      collagen production, matrix formation and matrix mineralisation. No difference
      was observed in TNF-alpha and IL-10 cytokine release from CD14+ monocytes as
      markers of inflammatory response across samples. Cell interdigitation into the
      porous structure of the PEO coatings was demonstrated and cell processes remained
      adherent to the porous structure despite rigorous sonication. This study shows
      that PEO technology can be used to modify the surface of low-modulus beta-type
      titanium alloys with porous structure facilitating osseointegration, without
      impeding osteoblast activity or introducing an untoward inflammatory response.

      Evolution of Cage Design and Early Radiological Outcomes and Fusion Rates.
PG  - 52-59
LID - 10.1111/os.12413 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the initial outcomes of a composite cage with integral
      fixation using the Redmond titanium (Ti)/polyetheretherketone (PEEK) anterior
      cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) device. METHODS: Data from 50 consecutive
      patients were prospectively collected from a single senior surgeon cohort. All
      cages were between 5 and 8 mm in height, and were packed with supercritical CO2
      sterilized allograft. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months, and
      implant complications were assessed. RESULTS: From the original cohort, three
      were unavailable for follow-up. Forty-seven patients with a total of 58 operative
      levels were observed for a mean of 7.9 months. A fusion rate of 96% was achieved.
      Good to excellent outcomes were seen in 92% of patients. There were no cases of
      implant Ti/PEEK delamination or implant failure, with excellent early fusion
      rates using supercritical CO2 allograft. CONCLUSIONS: The present study
      demonstrates the development of a composite ACDF cage design that is a safe and
      effective treatment option with the potential for early osseointegration and
      interbody fusion. Supercritical CO2 sterilized allograft was an effective graft
      material supporting fusion.

AB  - Our aim was to try and find out whether contamination with saliva during
      insertion of dental implants affects osseointegration in bone that has been
      augmented with different grafts. Six bony defects were created in each of the
      calvaria of six sheep, and then augmented with three different materials
      (autogenous bone, bovine bone, and resorbable biphasic ceramic bone substitute)
      After five weeks of healing, three implants contaminated with saliva
      (contaminated group) and three not contaminated (uncontaminated group) were
      placed in the centre of the augmented areas. For histomorphometric analysis, bone
      implant contact, bone area fraction occupancy, bone and material area, and bony
      area were measured after a healing period of five weeks. There was a significant 
      difference between the contaminated and uncontaminated groups (p=0.036) for bone 
      implant contact only in the augmented areas, but there were no significant
      differences in bone area fraction occupancy, bone and material area, and bony
      area. We conclude that contamination with saliva during placement of dental
      implants can significantly compromise bone implant contact in augmented areas,
      but had no significant effect on the formation of bone in areas more distant from
      the surface of the implant. We suggest that salivary contamination should be
      avoided during placement of dental implants in augmented areas.

AB  - "Bone conduction implant devices rely on osseointegration of titanium implants
      with the underlying skull, characterized by endosseous healing and de-novo bone
      formation both surrounding and onto the implant surface. The key steps in
      osseointegration are the initial tissue response to implantation, peri-implant
      osteogenesis, and peri-implant bone remodeling. There is increasing evidence that
      osseointegration is primarily an immune-mediated process with the key players
      being the complement cascade and macrophages, which form part of the host innate 
      immunity. Implant design and composition, patient systemic factors, surgical
      technique, and loading characteristics can all affect the success of
      osseointegration."

TI  - Adenoviral delivery of adiponectin ameliorates osteogenesis around implants in
      ovariectomized rats.
PG  - e3069
LID - 10.1002/jgm.3069 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adiponectin (APN) has been reported to promote bone formation.
      However, it is difficult to utilize a conventional method that administers
      sufficient APN to the implant site. The present study investigated the efficacy
      of an APN transgene to accelerate the implant osseointegration in ovariectomized 
      (OVX) rats. METHODS: In vitro, bone marrow stromal cells were transduced with
      reconstructed adenovirus (Ad-APN-EGFP) and osteoclast precursor RAW264.7 cells
      were co-cultured with the conditioned medium secreted by transduced bone marrow
      stromal cells. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and bone slice
      resorption assay were performed to evaluate the activity of osteoclastogenesis.
      In vivo, Ad-APN-EGFP was administered into the bone defect prior to implant
      placement in OVX rats. At 7 and 28 days post implantation, the femurs were
      harvested and prepared for a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
      reaction, hemotoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining,
      micro-computed tomography analysis and biomechanical testing. RESULTS: The
      results showed the formation and function of osteoclasts were significantly
      suppressed in vitro. Successful transgene expression was confirmed, and a
      significant increase of OCN, Runx2 and ALP expression was detected in the
      Ad-APN-EGFP group in vivo. Interestingly, we also found that the overexpression
      of APN decreased the expression level of potent adipogenic transcription factors 
      such as PPARgamma2 and C/EBP-alpha. At 28 days after implantation, the
      Ad-APN-EGFP group revealed a significantly increased osseointegration and implant
      stability in OVX rats compared to the control groups (Ad-EGFP and PBS groups).
      CONCLUSIONS: APN via direct adenovirus-mediated gene transfer could ameliorate
      osseointegration surrounding titanium implants in OVX-related osteoporosis rats. 
      Furthermore, it may be an effective strategy for promoting bone regeneration
      under osteoporotic conditions.

TI  - RGD Mutation of the Heparin Binding II Fragment of Fibronectin for Guiding
      Mesenchymal Stem Cell Behavior on Titanium Surfaces.
PG  - 3666-3678
LID - 10.1021/acsami.8b17138 [doi]
AB  - Installing bioactivity on metallic biomaterials by mimicking the extracellular
      matrix (ECM) is crucial for stimulating specific cellular responses to ultimately
      promote tissue regeneration. Fibronectin is an ECM protein commonly used for
      biomaterial functionalization. The use of fibronectin recombinant fragments is an
      attractive alternate to the use of full-length fibronectin because of the
      relatively low cost and facility of purification. However, it is necessary to
      combine more than one fragment, for example, the cell attachment site and the
      heparin binding II (HBII), either mixed or in one molecule, to obtain complete
      activity. In the present study, we proposed to install adhesion capacity to the
      HBII fragment by an RGD gain-of-function DNA mutation, retaining its cell
      differentiation capacity and thereby producing a small and very active protein
      fragment. The novel molecule, covalently immobilized onto titanium surfaces,
      maintained the growth factor-binding capacity and stimulated cell spreading,
      osteoblastic cell differentiation, and mineralization of human mesenchymal stem
      cells compared to the HBII native protein. These results highlight the potential 
      capacity of gain-of-function DNA mutations in the design of novel molecules for
      the improvement of osseointegration properties of metallic implant surfaces.

TI  - Hydroxyapatite Nanorod-Modified Sand Blasted Titanium Disk for Endosseous Dental 
      Implant Applications.
PG  - 601-614
LID - 10.1007/s13770-018-0151-9 [doi]
AB  - Background: Sand blasted titanium (Ti) is commonly used in designing endosseous
      dental implants due to its biocompatibility and ability to form bonds with bone
      tissues. However, titanium implants do not induce strong interactions with teeth 
      bones. To increase strong interactions between Ti disk implants and teeth bones, 
      the l-glutamic acid grafted hydroxyapatite nanorods (nHA) were immobilized on
      albumin modified Ti disk implants (Ti-Alb). Methods: For modification of Ti disk 
      implants by nHA, the l-glutamic acid grafted nHA was synthesized and then
      immobilized on albumin modified Ti disk implants. Fourier transformed infrared
      spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope;
      energy dispersive spectroscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used
      to confirm the modification of Ti disk implants. The bioactivity of nHA-modified 
      Ti disk implants was evaluated by seeding MC3T3-E1 cells on Ti-nHA implants.
      Results: Characterization techniques have confirmed the successful modification
      of Ti disk implants by l-glutamic acid grafted nHA. The nHA-modified Ti disk
      implants have shown enhanced adhesion, proliferation and cytotoxicity of MC3T3-E1
      cells in comparison to pristine Ti implants. Conclusions: The modification of Ti 
      implants by l-glutamic acid grafted nHA has produced highly osteogenic Ti disk
      plants in comparison to pristine Ti disk implants due to the formation of
      bioactive surfaces by hydroxyapatite nano rods on Ti disk implants. Ti-nHA disk
      implants showed enhanced adhesion, proliferation, and MC3T3-E1 cells viability in
      comparison to pristine Ti disk implants. Thus nHA might be to be useful to
      enhance the osseointegration of Ti implants with teeth bones.

TI  - Osteogenic Nanofibrous Coated Titanium Implant Results in Enhanced
      Osseointegration: In Vivo Preliminary Study in a Rabbit Model.
PG  - 231-247
LID - 10.1007/s13770-017-0106-6 [doi]
AB  - A titanium implant surface when coated with biodegradable, highly porous,
      osteogenic nanofibrous coating has shown enhanced intrinsic osteoinductive and
      osteoconductive properties. This coating mimics extracellular matrix resulting in
      differentiation of stem cells present in the peri-implant niche to osteoblast and
      hence results in enhanced osseointegration of the implant. The osteogenic
      nanofibrous coating (ONFC) consists of poly-caprolactone, gelatin, nano-sized
      hydroxyapatite, dexamethasone, ascorbic acid and beta-glycerophosphate. ONFC
      exhibits optimum mechanical properties to support mesenchymal stem cells and
      steer their osteogenic differentiation. ONFC was subjected to various
      characterization tests like scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform
      infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffractometry, thermal degradation,
      biomineralization, mechanical properties, wettability and proliferation assay. In
      pre-clinical animal trials, the coated implant showed enhanced new bone formation
      when placed in the tibia of rabbit. This novel approach toward implant bone
      integration holds significant promise for its easy and economical coating thus
      marking the beginning of new era of electrospun osteogenic nanofibrous coated
      bone implants.

PG  - 249-257
LID - 10.1007/s13534-018-0063-6 [doi]
AB  - The surface properties of implant are responsible to provide mechanical stability
      by creating an intimate bond between the bone and implant; hence, play a major
      role on osseointegration process. The current study was aimed to measure surface 
      characteristics of titanium modified by a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The results of
      this study revealed an optimum density of laser energy (140 Jcm(-2)), at which
      improvement of osteointegration process was seen. Significant differences were
      found between arithmetical mean height (Ra), root mean square deviation (Rq) and 
      texture orientation, all were lower for 140 Jcm(-2) samples compared to untreated
      one. Also it was identified that the surface segments were more uniformly
      distributed with a more Gaussian distribution for treated samples at 140 Jcm(-2).
      The distribution of texture orientation at high laser density (250 and 300
      Jcm(-2)) were approximately similar to untreated sample. The skewness index that 
      indicates how peaks and valleys are distributed throughout the surface showed a
      positive value for laser treated samples, compared to untreated one. The surface 
      characterization revealed that Kurtosis index, which tells us how high or flat
      the surface profile is, for treated sample at 140 Jcm(-2) was marginally close to
      3 indicating flat peaks and valleys in the surface profile.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of Different Bone Markers in Peri-implant Crevicular Fluid
      of Immediate Loaded and Nonloaded Dental Implants.
PG  - 1341-1345
AB  - AIM: The present study was conducted to determine different bone markers in
      immediate loaded and nonloaded dental implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It
      comprised of 60 patients (males-30, females-30) which were divided into two
      groups of 30 each. Group I received immediate loaded dental implants, and group
      II received non-loaded dental implants. Modified bleeding on probing index,
      peri-implant sulcus depth was assessed in both groups at 1 month, 2 months, 3
      months and 4 months. The crevicular fluid was obtained to determine bone markers 
      levels such as transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-a), osteocalcin (OCN),
      osteopontin (OPN), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). RESULTS: 
      Both groups revealed non-significant difference in modified bleeding on probing
      index and peri-implant sulcus depth (p > 0.05). Bone markers found to be elevated
      more in group I as compared to group II. However, the difference was non-
      significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-a),
      OCN, OPN, OPG and PTH and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were higher in
      immediate loaded dental implants as compared to nonloaded dental implants.
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Immediate loaded dental implants showed an increase in
      expression of bone markers such as TNF-a, OCN, OPN, PTH and OPG which may be
      useful in deciding future of immediate loaded dental implants.

AB  - For the first time, a biomimetic method has been developed for the chemical
      modification of poly-l-lysine (PLL) with catechol in order to improve polymer
      adhesion to inorganic particles and surfaces. The method is based on the Schiff
      base reaction of amino groups of PLL monomers and aldehyde groups of
      3,4-dihydroxybenzylaldehyde (DHBA) molecules. It was found that adherent PLL-DHBA
      films can be prepared by cathodic electrophoretic deposition (EPD). Nanocomposite
      coating with dual micro-nano topography has been developed for orthopaedic and
      dental coating applications. The catechol groups of PLL-DHBA facilitated its
      adsorption on hydroxyapatite (HA) and rutile (TiO2) and allowed the fabrication
      of stable suspensions for EPD. PLL-DHBA was used as both a charging and
      film-forming agent for EPD of HA and TiO2. Moreover, the methods allowed
      co-deposition of HA and TiO2 and fabrication of composite films, which allows the
      benefits of both bioceramics to be combined. In addition to having dual scale
      topography, the films exhibited both sub-micron surface roughness and hydrophilic
      behaviour, which both have been found to promote osteoblast adhesion and
      proliferation. in vitro studies revealed that the fabricated coatings showed
      increased cell metabolism and alkaline phosphatase activity over the period
      studied, with PLL-DHBA-TiO2 showing the greatest increase. This work paves the
      way for both the development of the next generation of biomedical implant
      coatings, with improved osseointegration and lifespan, as well as one-step
      low-temperature processing.

AB  - PURPOSE: Carbonate apatite (CO3Ap), an inorganic component of human bone, can be 
      fabricated in chemically pure form from calcium carbonate block via a
      dissolution-precipitation reaction. A first-in-human clinical trial was conducted
      in which low-crystalline CO3Ap granules were evaluated for safety and efficacy in
      sinus floor augmentation and simultaneous implant installation. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Procedures were performed in 8 patients (9 implants) with 2 granule
      sizes: small (300 to 600 mum) and medium (600 to 1,000 mum). Panoramic
      radiographic assessment was performed immediately after augmentation, 7 +/- 2
      months after augmentation, 6 +/- 2 months after prosthetic loading, and 12 +/- 2 
      months after prosthetic loading. RESULTS: Postoperative healing was uniformly
      uneventful, with no abnormal bleeding, pain, or swelling, and all implants
      achieved successful osseointegration. The mean residual maxillary molar bone
      height was 5.2 +/- 0.8 mm preoperatively and increased to 14.0 +/- 1.9 mm after
      augmentation. Implants 9.0 to 11.5 mm in length were placed. The
      post-augmentation height decreased to 12.4 +/- 1.3 mm at 7 +/- 2 months; after
      prosthetic loading, it decreased to 11.9 +/- 0.8 mm at 6 +/- 2 months and 11.7
      +/- 0.6 mm at 12 +/- 2 months. No abnormal bone resorption of the augmented areas
      was observed, and bone height supporting the implants was maintained. The overall
      implant survival rate was 100%, with no implant failures or complications during 
      the first year. CONCLUSIONS: Low-crystalline CO3Ap granules were useful and safe 
      for sinus floor augmentation and simultaneous implant installation, providing a
      promising bone substitute for dental implant surgery.

AB  - Deficient osseointegration and implant-related infections are pivotal issues for 
      the long-term clinical success of titanium (Ti) implants. Zinc (Zn) and strontium
      (Sr) serve dual functions by promoting osteogenesis and inhibiting bone
      destruction, and Zn has good antibacterial activity. As such, this study examined
      the preparation of a Zn/Sr-doped titanium dioxide microporous coating (MT-Zn/Sr) 
      on a Ti surface using microarc oxidation (MAO), with Zn and Sr evenly distributed
      throughout the coating. In vitro, the coating could promote the adhesion,
      proliferation, differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts, showing good
      biological activity. Antibacterial testing demonstrated the good antibacterial
      activity of the coating, as it inhibited the proliferation of Staphylococcus. In 
      vivo, MT-Zn/Sr promoted early osseointegration between the Ti substrate and the
      bone tissue. This work is expected to provide a new method for improving the
      biological activity of Ti implants and thus has important theoretical
      significance and great clinical prospects.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A main challenge in treatment of peri-implant disease is the
      effective decontamination of the implant surface. This challenge has always been 
      a problem, associated with the treatment of these diseases with regard to the
      difficulty in removing and eliminating bacterial biofilm from the surface of
      dental implants, especially rough surfaces. The aim of this in-vivo study was to 
      evaluate the effect of five different antimicrobial methods in reducing bacteria 
      adhering to titanium surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present in-vivo
      study, the contaminated discs, except for the negative control group, randomly
      underwent one of five treatments: Erbium: Yattrium Aluminum Garnet (Er-YAG)
      laser, plastic curette, 0.12% chlorhexidine, aPDT, and 810 nm diode laser. A
      pectrophotometer was used to measure Optical Density (OD) in case of aerobic
      microorganisms. Colony-Forming Units (CFUs) were used for anaerobic bacteria.
      Then, all the analyses were carried out at a significance level of alpha = 0.05
      through SPSS software. FINDINGS: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of aerobic 
      bacteria showed a significant difference among 6 groups in terms of OD variations
      during a 0-24 h time interval (P < 0.001). The results of Kruskal-Wallis test
      were used to investigate the effect of study methods on anaerobic bacteria after 
      48 h, and the results showed a significant difference among 6 groups in terms of 
      CFUs (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study showed that all
      five mechanicals (plastic curette), chemical (CHX), laser (810 nm diode and Er:
      YAG), and aPDT methods could reduce oral biofilms from roughed surfaces of
      titanium discs. Er: YAG laser and plastic curette had the highest and the lowest 
      effects respectively.

TI  - On inflammation-immunological balance theory-A critical apprehension of disease
      concepts around implants: Mucositis and marginal bone loss may represent normal
      conditions and not necessarily a state of disease.
PG  - 183-189
LID - 10.1111/cid.12711 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral implants have displayed clinical survival results at the 95%-99%
      level for over 10 years of follow up. Nevertheless, some clinical researchers see
      implant disease as a most common phenomenon. Oral implants are regarded to
      display disease in the form of mucositis or peri-implantitis. One purpose of the 
      present article is to investigate whether a state of disease is necessarily
      occurring when implants display soft tissue inflammation or partially lose their 
      bony attachment. Another purpose of this article is to analyze the mode of
      defense for implants that are placed in a bacteria rich environment and to
      analyze when an obtained steady state between tissue and the foreign materials is
      disturbed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present article is authored as a narrative 
      review contribution. RESULTS: Evidence is presented that further documents the
      fact that implants are but foreign bodies that elicit a foreign body response
      when placed in bone tissue. The foreign body response is characterized by a bony 
      demarcation of implants in combination with a chronic inflammation in soft
      tissues. Oral implants survive in the bacteria-rich environments where they are
      placed due to a dual defense system in form of chronic inflammation coupled to
      immunological cellular actions. Clear evidence is presented that questions the
      automatic diagnostics of an oral implant disease based on the finding of so
      called mucositis that in many instances represents but a normal tissue response
      to foreign body implants instead of disease. Furthermore, neither is marginal
      bone loss around implants necessarily indicative of a disease; the challenge to
      the implant represented by bone resorption may be successfully counteracted by
      local defense mechanisms and a new tissue-implant steady state may evolve.
      Similar reactions including chronic inflammation occur in the interface of
      orthopedic implants that display similarly good long-term results as do oral
      implants, if mainly evaluated based on revision surgery in orthopedic cases. The 
      most common mode of failure of orthopedic implants is aseptic loosening which has
      been found coupled to a reactivation of the inflammatory- immune system.
      CONCLUSIONS: Implants survive in the body due to balanced defense reactions in
      form of chronic inflammation and activation of the innate immune system. Ten year
      results of oral and hip /knee implants are hence in the 90+ percentage region.
      Clinical problems may occur with bone resorption that in most cases is
      successfully counterbalanced by the defense/healing systems. However, in certain 
      instances implant failure will ensue characterized by bacterial attacks and/or by
      reactivation of the immune system that now will act to remove the foreign bodies 
      from the tissues.

TI  - Bone-Healing Pattern on the Surface of Titanium Implants at Cortical and Marrow
      Compartments in Two Topographic Sites: an Experimental Study in Rabbits.
LID - E85 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma12010085 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluates the bone-healing patterns on the surface of titanium
      implants at the cortical and marrow compartments of bicortically-installed
      implants in the diaphysis and metaphysis of rabbit tibiae. In 27 New Zealand
      rabbits, two implants, one for each macro-design and with equal resorbable
      blasted media (RBM) implant surfaces, were randomly implanted in the diaphysis or
      metaphysis of each tibia. The flaps were sutured to allow submerged healing. The 
      animals were sacrificed after two, four, or eight weeks, with nine weeks used for
      the period of healing. Ground sections were prepared and analyzed. No
      statistically significant differences were found between the two groups for newly
      formed bone in contact with the implant surface after two, four, and eight weeks 
      of healing. Bone apposition in the marrow compartment was slightly higher in the 
      diaphysis compared to metaphysis regions across healing stages. Despite the
      limitations of the present study, it can be concluded that new bone apposition
      was better than average in the cortical compartment as compared to the marrow
      compartments. Bone morphometry and density may affect bone apposition onto the
      implant surface. The apposition rates were slightly better at both the cortical
      and marrow compartments in diaphysis as compared to metaphysis sites. The new
      bone formation at the marrow compartment showed slightly better increasing values
      at diaphysis compared to metaphysis implantation sites.

TI  - PEEK materials as an alternative to titanium in dental implants: A systematic
      review.
PG  - 208-222
LID - 10.1111/cid.12706 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Evaluation of the available research on PEEK materials to find that
      whether PEEK material has favorable properties and can enhance osseointegration, 
      so that they can be utilize as implants material. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An
      electronic and structured systematic search was undertaken in May 2018, without
      any restrictions of time in the Medline/Pubmed, Sci-hub, Ebscohost, Cochrane, and
      Web of Science databases. To identify other related references further hand
      search was done. Articles related to PEEK and their applications in implants were
      only included. Articles not available in abstract form and article other than
      English language were excluded. RESULTS: Initially, the search resulted in 153
      papers. Independent screenings of the abstracts were done by the reviewers to
      identify the articles related to the question in focus. Sixty-two studies were
      selected out of which 10 were further excluded due to not in English language.
      Two additional papers were obtained after hand searching, and finally 54 articles
      were included in the review. CONCLUSIONS: Surface modification of PEEK seems to
      enhance the cell adhesion, proliferation, biocompability, and osteogenic
      properties of PEEK implant materials. PEEK had also influence the biofilm
      structure and reduces the chances of periimplant inflammations. Further research 
      and more number of controlled clinical trials on PEEK implant is required in near
      future so that it can replace titanium in future.

TI  - The Effect of Smoking Behavior on Alveolar Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells of 
      Clinical Implant Patient.
PG  - 7672695
LID - 10.1155/2018/7672695 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The hazardous effects of smoking on the alveolar bone healing after
      implant surgery and nicotine on the biofunction of human alveolar bone marrow
      mesenchymal stem cells (hABMMSCs) were reported. There was little direct evidence
      regarding the specific detrimental effects of the smoking on hABMMSCs. The aim of
      this study was to test the influence of smoking behavior on hABMMSCs and the
      osseointegration situation after implant surgery. Methods: hABMMSCs from 6 dental
      implant patients randomly (3 smokers and 3 nonsmokers) were compared. The cell
      viability, colony forming unit, and cell cycle were performed to assay
      proliferation capacity. The Oil Red O staining, Alizarin Red staining, alkaline
      phosphatase staining and activity, adipogenic and osteogenic gene expressions in 
      vitro, and bone formation ectopically in vivo were performed under proper
      inductions, respectively, to assay multilineage differentiation. Besides the
      implant stability quotient and marginal bone loss were checked in both groups.
      Results: Smoking hABMMSCs showed lower proliferation in vitro and poorer bone
      regeneration capacity in vivo. Moreover, smokers performed worse on bone healing 
      after implant surgery. Conclusions: Our results suggested smoking had the
      detrimental genetic effect on proliferation and osteogenesis of hABMMSCs and the 
      decreased biofunction of hABMMSCs was positively related with bone healing.
      Clinical Significance: The present study provided direct evidence about hazardous
      effects of smoking behavior on hABMMSCs. Smoking decreased the osteogenesis and
      proliferation of hABMMSCs in vivo and in vitro, and smoking was positively
      related with osseointegration reduction. Prevention of smoking behavior may
      promote biofunction of hABMMSCs and successful rate of dental implant.

TI  - A 30-Year Follow-Up of a Patient with Mandibular Complete-Arch Fixed
      Implant-Supported Prosthesis on 4 Implants: A Clinical Report.
PG  - 97-102
LID - 10.1111/jopr.13012 [doi]
AB  - Mandibular complete-arch fixed implant-supported prostheses are recognized as one
      of the earliest and most popular prostheses in implant dentistry. This prosthesis
      was the main focus in the early era of osseointegration. Despite its widespread
      popularity, few clinical reports have described long-term follow-up greater than 
      10 years for this type of prosthesis. This report describes a 30-year follow-up
      of a patient who underwent treatment for a mandibular complete-arch fixed
      implant-supported prosthesis with 4 machined surfaced implants, opposing a
      maxillary complete denture. This report documents a variety of photographs and
      radiographs taken over a period of 30 years to compare bone levels at various
      stages of care and maintenance, including de novo bone formation underneath the
      distal cantilevers due to functional loading. The biologic and biomechanical
      response to this treatment protocol and long-term clinical observations and
      prosthodontic outcome and maintenance needs are also addressed.

TI  - Reconstruction of mandibular bone defects using biphasic calcium phosphate bone
      substitutes with simultaneous implant placement in mini-swine: A pilot in vivo
      study.
LID - 10.1002/jbm.b.34299 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate implant osseointegration using a new strategy of 
      biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) bone substitutes with simultaneous implant
      placement in mandibular reconstruction. Additionally, the temporal
      transcriptional profile associated with the early biological processes during
      osseointegration was determined. BCP and hydroxyapatite (HA) bone substitutes
      with simultaneous implant placement were grafted into mandibular defects created 
      in mini-swine. Radiographic, histological, and biochemical analyses were applied 
      for evaluation of osseointegration effects at 4 months after the grafting
      procedure. Bone formation around the implant was assessed by the bone area
      percentage (BA%) and the bone-implant-contact percentage (BIC%). The
      biomechanical evaluation was performed by the implant pullout test and the
      removal torque test. Microarray technology was utilized for gene expression
      comparison analysis at day 14 postoperatively. Radiographic and histological
      observation indicated enhanced bone formation in the BCP group compared to the HA
      group. Histomorphometric analyses of BA% and BIC% as well as biochemical analyses
      of the maximal pull-out force and the ultimate shear strength were all
      significantly greater in the BCP group (p < 0.05). Transcriptional analysis at an
      early stage of osseointegration revealed that genes belonging to biological
      processes associated with cell proliferation, development, osteogenesis,
      angiogenesis, and neurogenesis as well as the osteogenesis-related TGF-beta/BMP
      and WNT signaling pathways were upregulated in the BCP group. In conclusion, the 
      reconstruction of mandibular defects using BCP with simultaneous implant
      placement resulted in superior osseointegration effects. A number of candidate
      genes that were differentially expressed may contribute to the superior
      osseointegration effects. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res B

TI  - Relative effects of age on implant integration in a rat model: A longitudinal in 
      vivo microct study.
PG  - 541-552
LID - 10.1002/jor.24210 [doi]
AB  - The effect of age on implant fixation in bone is not always considered during the
      design of preclinical models. The decision on animal's age is often related to
      practical or historical reasons, which ultimately may affect the reproducibility 
      of results. This study aimed to quantify the effect of age by monitoring the
      fixation of contrast-enhanced PEEK screws in rats, hypothesizing that the
      kinetics of fixation is impaired in older animals but that age effects are less
      severe than osteoporotic effects. The time course of implant fixation was
      investigated in healthy rats at 24, 40, and 60 weeks of age; and in
      ovariectomized rats. Implant fixation was monitored using in-vivo microCT and
      dynamic histomorphometry during 1 month. The rats were euthanized 28 days post
      screw insertion. The data was analyzed both in absolute value and after
      normalization to baseline bone mass. In absolute terms, greater age had a
      detrimental effect on bone implant contact, bone fraction, implant stiffness, and
      bone remodeling but less than ovariectomy. Interestingly, once data was
      normalized to baseline bone mass this effect disappeared, suggesting that the
      physiologic response to implant placement was not affected by age. In conclusion,
      implant fixation kinetics is less affected by age than by baseline bone mass in
      this rat model. Animals of different ages can therefore be compared but data must
      be construed relatively to baseline bone mass and not in absolute terms. (c) 2018

AB  - Nano to submicron scaled surface possesses excellent biological affinity and
      several processes have been undertaken to develop titanium implant with specific 
      surface chemical and phase composition and nano-scale features. A simple process 
      was used to modify the nano topographies on a micro-arc-oxidation (MAO) surface
      which shortens the time for the conventional hydrothermal process (HT).
      Nano-scaled anatase precipitates on the MAO surface with different
      crystallinities and morphologies were regulated via microwave-assisted
      hydrothermal in pure water (MWDD) or in pH conditioned mediums containing calcium
      and phosphorus ions (MWCP, MWCP9, MWCP11). The surface morphologies and
      structures were investigated by SEM, XRD, FTIR, and TEM. Anatase crystals as
      nano-spikes along [001] direction were observed on the surface of the MWDD and
      MWCP groups. Increasing the pH of the conditioned medium leads the precipitate to
      lose its crystallinity; the surface of MWCP11 is covered with amorphous anatase
      which has a 3D nano-sheet architecture. The MW treated surfaces possess superior 
      hydrophilicity can adsorb more proteins (fibronectin and bovine serum albumin),
      and the osteoblasts-like MG63 cells on these surfaces have higher spreading
      ratios than on the MAO and HT groups. The cell viabilities in the MW groups were 
      significantly higher than in the MAO and HT groups on the 7th day (P<0.05),
      although their cell viabilities were similar on the first day. MWCP and MWCP11
      have higher alkaline phosphatase activity on days 7 and 14 compared to other
      groups (P<0.05). The MW treatment produces different nanomorphologies on the MAO 
      surface and retains the original micro/submicron pores and surface calcium and
      phosphorus contents, thus it is expected to promote osseointegration without
      compromising the bond strength.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electron beam melting (EBM) technique enables cage design changes
      such as the integration of guide rails on the cage surface or a 3D matrix for
      osseointegration. A change in manufacturing technique or design can lead to a
      decreased fusion rate or impaired applicability. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the
      present study was to evaluate cage handling, lordosis reconstruction capability, 
      and fusion rate 1 year after surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 50
      patients who had undergone minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody
      fusion (TLIF) or open posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) using an
      EBM-manufactured cage were retrospectively included. Fusion evaluation was based 
      on routinely performed CTs and flexion-extension radiographs 12 months
      postoperatively. Lumbar and segmental lordosis were compared between pre-, post, 
      and 1year follow-up. Postoperative cage position was used for evaluation of cage 
      handling. RESULTS: The radiological fusion rate was 97% at the 1year follow-up.
      Two cages were placed into the endplates during surgery without an effect on
      fusion. In 31% of the cages, placement at the anterior third of the disk space
      was possible. Lumbar lordosis was improved by a mean of 5 degrees and segmental
      lordosis by a mean of 4 degrees . At final follow-up, 1 degrees was lost in both 
      parameters. No implant-associated complications were registered. CONCLUSION: The 
      implant is safe and leads to a very high fusion rate. A learning curve results
      from the fact that the cage follows a defined radius dictated by the guide rails.
      Addressing this, exact placement at the anterior endplate can be achieved.

AB  - Biomaterials have been widely used for stomatological reconstructive surgery in
      recent years. Many studies have demonstrated that the porous structure of an
      implant promotes bone ingrowth and its stiffness can be controlled via the design
      of the porosity. Although some researchers have paid attention to investigating
      the porous structure for dental implants, the biomechanical properties and
      osseointegration have not been well studied. In this study, finite element
      analysis and experiments have been used to evaluate the biomechanical performance
      and osseointegration of dental implants with porous/solid structures fabricated
      by selective laser melting using commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti, Grade 2). The
      implants were tested and the fracture surfaces were observed by scanning electron
      microscope to investigate the failure mechanisms. To reduce bone resorption, the 
      porosity of dental implant was designed to optimize its stiffness. Finally,
      animal experiments revealed that bone tissue ingrowth was seen into the porous
      structure. It is believed that the porous dental implants have great potential in
      future applications.

TI  - The topography and proliferative activity of cells immunoreactive to various
      growth factors in rat femoral bone tissues after experimental fracture and
      implantation of titanium implants with bioactive biodegradable coatings.
PG  - 85-95
LID - 10.3233/BME-181035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biodegradable implant coatings promote proliferation and expression
      of BMP-2, VEGF, and TGF-beta2 genes and enhance BMP-2, VEGF, and TGF-beta2
      regulatory effects at different stages of reparative osteogenesis. OBJECTIVE: To 
      study the topography and ratio of PCNA-, VEGF-, BMP-2-, and
      TGF-beta2-immunoreactive cells in rat femoral bone after closed fracture and
      implantation of titanium implants with biodegradable calcium phosphate and
      hydroxyapatite coatings. METHODS: Standard titanium implant screws and similar
      implants with bioactive coatings were used. A total of 18 rats were randomly
      divided into three groups, two experimental and a control one. The rats in the
      first experimental group were implanted with implants without specific coating,
      while those in the second group, with implants with specific coatings. The
      control rats were subjected to the same fracture as the experimental ones without
      subsequent implantation. On days 7, 14, and 30 of experiment, the rats were
      sampled for histological examination. Histological sections were prepared and
      processed for PCNA, BMP-2, VEGF, and TGF-beta2 immunoreactivity. RESULTS: In the 
      regeneration zone, PCNA-immunoreactive cells substantially outnumbered other
      immunoreactive cell types. During the first two weeks after fracture, in the
      immediate vicinity of implant surface, the rate of VEGF production increased in
      osteoblast subpopulations and level of TGF-32 immunoreactivity decreased in
      chondroblasts. The level of TGF-32 was maximum on day 30 of experiment.
      BMP-2-immunoreactive osteocytes were found in the zone of external general
      plates. They accumulated at implants with calcium phosphate coating. Their number
      gradually increased by day 30 of experiment. CONCLUSIONS: The present data
      suggest that biodegradable implant coatings promote proliferation and expression 
      of BMP-2, VEGF, and TGF-beta2 genes and enhance BMP-2, VEGF, and TGF-beta2
      regulatory effects at different stages of reparative osteogenesis.

AB  - Titania nanotubes (Ti-NTs) have been proven to be good drug carriers and can
      release drugs efficiently around implants. Enoxacin (EN) is a broad-spectrum
      antibiotic that has the ability of anti-osteoclastogenesis. Immobilization of
      extracellular matrix components on the surface of the material can greatly
      enhance the biological activity of the implant and slow down the release rate of 
      the drug in Ti-NTs. In the present study, a material system that provided uniform
      drug release, promoted osteogenesis, and inhibited osteoclast was designed and
      developed. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and
      water contact angle measurements were used for material surface characterization.
      Enoxacin release was detected by high performance liquid chromatography. Alkaline
      phosphatase and Alizarin Red staining were used to evaluate the osteogenic
      differentiation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Tartrate-resistant
      acid phosphatase staining and bone absorption assay were applied to
      osteoclastogenesis experiments. A drug delivery system based on Ti-NTs and type I
      collagen /hyaluronic acid multilayer coating (Ti-NT+EN+Col/HyA) with predominant 
      biocompatibility, osteogenic property, and anti-osteoclastogenesis ability was
      successfully constructed. These excellent biological properties were further
      validated in an ovariectomized rat model. The results of the study indicate that 
      Ti-NT+EN+Col/HyA is a potential material for future orthopedic implants.

AB  - The mechanism of osseointegration is related to many factors, including the
      quality of the bone, the biocompatibility and surface characteristics of the
      implant material, the surgical technique, and functional loading. The purpose of 
      this study was to investigate the effects of hyaluronic acid gel on the
      osseointegration of implants placed in defined areas of the mandible in rabbits. 
      Hyaluronic acid is known to have an osteoinductive effect during regeneration of 
      bony defects, and we thought that it might also have a favourable effect on
      osseointegration, a specialised mechanism to heal bone. Ten New Zealand rabbits
      aged 10 weeks and weighing 2.5-3.0kg were used, and sites for implants that were 
      far enough from the apices of the teeth in the mandibular molar area were chosen.
      Two cavities were prepared in each rabbit, one (anterior) for the control
      implant, and one (posterior) for the implant with hyaluronic acid gel (Medical
      Instinct GmbH, Bovenden). New bone and the osteoid matrix content around the
      dental implants were evaluated histologically and histomorphometrically two
      months after the operation, and no significant difference was found between the
      two groups.

AB  - Development of surface treatments has enabled secure attachment of dental
      implants in less than 1 month. Consequently, it is necessary to characterize
      accurately the osseointegration of the implant surface in the region of the
      bone-implant contact (BIC). We developed a method for sample preparation that
      preserves both bone and BIC to permit analysis of the contact interface. We
      prepared eight nanotextured implants and implanted them in rabbit tibias. After
      healing for 30 days, outcomes were analyzed using both our bone preservation
      protocol and routine decalcification followed by preparation of histological
      sections stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H & E). Pull-out tests for implant
      osseointegration were performed after healing. Non-implanted samples of rabbit
      mandible were used as a control for assessing organic and mineralized bone
      characteristics and bone structure. Our bone preservation protocol enabled
      evaluation of many of the same bone characteristics as histological sections
      stained with H & E. Our protocol enables analysis of implant samples, implant
      surfaces and osseointegration without risk of BIC damage.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study examined the mid- to long-term clinical and 
      radiographic performance of a tapered implant in various treatment protocols in
      patients with local and systemic risk factors (RFs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two
      hundred seven NobelActive implants were inserted in 98 patients in the period
      from 10/2008 to 02/2015. The subdivision of the cohort was defined by local (n = 
      40), systemic (n = 6), local and systemic (n = 8), or without any RFs (n = 44) to
      analyze implant survival and marginal bone levels. RESULTS: Fifteen implants
      failed within the follow-up period. The mean follow-up period of the remaining
      implants was 34 months (range 12 to 77 months). The cumulative survival rate
      according to Kaplan-Meier was 91.5%. The survival rate for 93 implants in 45
      patients with no RFs was 94.8% whereas it was 94% for 83 implants in 48 patients 
      with local RFs (p = 0.618), 81.3% for 14 implants in 6 patients with systemic RFs
      (p = 0.173), and 76.5% for 17 implants in 6 patients with local and systemic risk
      factors (p = 0.006). The interproximal marginal bone level was - 0.49 +/- 0.83 mm
      at the mesial aspect and - 0.51 +/- 0.82 mm at the distal aspect in relation to
      implant shoulder level and showed no relevant difference in the various risk
      factor groups. CONCLUSIONS: It can be assumed that the negative effects of the
      local or/and systemic risk factors were partially compensated by the primary
      stability and grade of osseointegration of the NobelActive implant. CLINICAL
      RELEVANCE: The use of this system in patients with risk factors and immediate
      loading procedures.

TI  - Polydopamine-induced hydroxyapatite coating facilitates hydroxyapatite/polyamide 
      66 implant osteogenesis: an in vitro and in vivo evaluation.
PG  - 8179-8193
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S181137 [doi]
AB  - Background: Hydroxyapatite/polyamide 66 (HA/P66) has been clinically used for
      several years owing to its good biocompatibility and bioactivity. However, it has
      been found that the osseointegration process of the HA/P66 implant takes a large 
      amount of time because of the small amount of HA on its surface. Methods: To
      increase the amount of HA and aid faster osseointegration, we prepared a HA
      coating using a biomimetic process assisted by polydopamine (PDA) on the HA/P66
      substrate. The surface properties of the substrate modified by PDA and HA were
      characterized, and the capacity of biomaterials for osteogenic induction was
      investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Results: The HA coating was successfully 
      prepared on the HA/P66 substrate and verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
      (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The HA
      coating remained firmly attached to the underlying PDA-HA/P66 substrate even
      after strong ultrasound treatment for 1 h, and the calcium and phosphorus of the 
      HA coating was continuously released in vitro in a slow manner. The formation of 
      the HA coating on the PDA film greatly increased the hydrophilicity and surface
      roughness of HA/P66. In cell-based experiments, as compared with the HA/P66
      substrate, the HA coating formation on the PDA film could facilitate the
      functions of C3H10T1/2 cells, including cell adhesion, proliferation, spreading, 
      alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium nodule formation, and expression of
      osteogenic differentiation-related proteins. In addition, the HA/P66 scaffolds
      modified with PDA and HA coatings were implanted in rabbit femoral condyles. At 8
      weeks after surgery, micro-computed tomography scanning (micro-CT) and
      hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining revealed that more new bones were formed around
      the HA/P66 scaffold that was modified with a PDA-assisted HA coating. Conclusion:
      These results indicate that the preparation of a PDA-assisted HA coating by using
      a biomimetic process significantly improves the capacity of biomaterials for
      osteogenic induction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Implant-related infection is a devastating complication in orthopedic 
      surgery. Aiming to minimize this problem, many material modifications have been
      developed. Here we report a study of a surface modification of Ti-6 Al-4 V alloy 
      using a methodology that enables the study of interactions between bacteria and
      the material in the presence of eukaryotic cells. METHODS: We mixed different
      concentrations of collection or clinical strains of staphylococci isolated from
      implant-related infections with preosteoblastic cells using a previously
      published methodology, analyzing the minimal concentration of bacteria able to
      colonize the surface of the material through image analysis. Ti-6 Al-4 V alloy
      was modified by anodization to obtain two F-doped nanostructured surfaces that
      have been previously described to have antibacterial properties. RESULTS: Our
      results show similar bacterial adhesion results to nanoporous and nanotubular
      F-doped surfaces. The presence of preosteoblastic cells increases the adherence
      of all bacterial strains to both structures. No effect of the surface on
      eukaryotic cells adherence was detected. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is
      the first time that anin vitro study emulating the race for the surface evaluates
      and compares the osseointegration and antibacterial properties between two
      nanostructured- modified titanium alloy surfaces. Clinical strains show different
      behavior from collection ones in bacterial adherence. The presence of cells
      increased bacterial adherence. NP and NT surface modifications didn t show
      significant differences in bacterial adhesion and preosteoblastic cells
      integration.

TI  - Cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor levels in peri-implant sulcus during wound
      healing and osseointegration after piezosurgical versus conventional implant site
      preparation: Randomized, controlled, split-mouth trial.
LID - 10.1002/JPER.18-0216 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor levels in
      peri-implant sulcular fluid (PISF) during healing and osseointegration at
      osteotomy sites prepared either with piezosurgery (PS) or drills. METHODS:
      Fourteen patients having contralateral partial edentulism in the posterior
      maxilla were enrolled and 38 osteotomies were prepared. Implants were placed with
      one-stage surgery. Insertion torque, early healing index, probing depth and
      modified gingival and plaque indices and crestal bone loss (CBL) were measured.
      PISF was collected from each implant at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 and were
      analyzed by a 30-Plex immunoassay. Data analysis employed Brunner-Langer method. 
      RESULTS: CBL values did not depend on osteotomy modality (P > 0.05). Eighteen
      molecules (interleukine (IL)-1beta, granulocyte colony stimulating factor
      (G.CSF), IL-13, IL-6, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alpha, IL-2, IL-2 R,
      IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, monocyte
      chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10,
      monokine induced by IFN-gamma (MIG), epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte
      growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) showed
      time-dependent decrease (P < 0.05), but they were not treatment-dependent (P >
      0.05). When values of weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24 were compared to week 2, it was
      found that all were highest at week 2 and decreased thereafter (P < 0.05). The
      decrease was significant at weeks 4 or 8 for multitude of molecules and was
      mostly sustained throughout the follow-up. Week 8 regulated on activation, normal
      T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) values in PS group were lower in PS group 
      compared to drill group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Implants placed into osteotomies 
      created with PS and drills are similar in terms of PISF biomarker changes during 
      the osseointegration and wound healing period. When clinical and CBL parameters
      were taken into account together with the PISF molecular data it can be
      speculated that PS and conventional drill osteotomy have similar effects on
      peri-implant tissues on the biochemical, clinical and radiological levels.

TI  - An antibiofilm coating of 5-aryl-2-aminoimidazole covalently attached to a
      titanium surface.
LID - 10.1002/jbm.b.34283 [doi]
AB  - Biofilms, especially those formed by Staphylococcus aureus, play a key role in
      the development of orthopedic implant infections. Eradication of these infections
      is challenging due to the elevated tolerance of biofilm cells against
      antimicrobial agents. In this study, we developed an antibiofilm coating
      consisting of 5-(4-bromophenyl)-N-cyclopentyl-1-octyl-1H-imidazol-2-amine,
      designated as LC0024, covalently bound to a titanium implant surface (LC0024-Ti).
      We showed in vitro that the LC0024-Ti surface reduces biofilm formation of S.
      aureus in a specific manner without reducing the planktonic cells above the
      biofilm, as evaluated by plate counting and fluorescence microscopy. The
      advantage of compounds that only inhibit biofilm formation without affecting the 
      viability of the planktonic cells, is that reduced development of bacterial
      resistance is expected. To determine the antibiofilm activity of LC0024-Ti
      surfaces in vivo, a biomaterial-associated murine infection model was used. The
      results indicated a significant reduction in S. aureus biofilm formation (up to
      96%) on the LC0024-Ti substrates compared to pristine titanium controls.
      Additionally, we found that the LC0024-Ti substrates did not affect the
      attachment and proliferation of human cells involved in osseointegration and bone
      repair. In summary, our results emphasize the clinical potential of covalent
      coatings of LC0024 on titanium implant surfaces to reduce the risk of orthopedic 
      implant infections. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res B Part B:

TI  - Effect of Titanium Implants Coated with Radiation-Crosslinked Collagen on
      Stability and Osseointegration in Rat Tibia.
LID - E2520 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma11122520 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the titanium (Ti) implants coated with collagen type
      crosslinked using gamma-irrigation or glutaraldehyde (GA). The in vitro surface
      observations, quantification assay, and cell studies using human mesenchymal stem
      cells (hMSCs) were conducted. For in vivo experiments, the implants were divided 
      into three groups and inserted into the rat tibias: control group (non-treated Ti
      implant), GA group (Ti implants coated with GA-crosslinked collagen) and 25 kGy
      group (Ti implants coated with gamma-radiation-crosslinked collagen at dose of 25
      kGy). The animals were sacrificed at 4 weeks after implantation and the tissue
      sections were obtained. New bone volume (mm(3)) and bone-to-implant contact (BIC,
      %) within the region of interest (ROI) was measured. The in vitro results showed 
      the highest osteogenic differentiation and levels of osteogenesis-related gene
      expressions in the 25 kGy group without cytotoxicity. The new bone volume of GA
      group was significantly higher than the control (p < 0.05). In the result of the 
      BIC, the 25 kGy group was significantly higher than the control (p < 0.05).
      However, there was no significant difference between the experimental groups.
      Within the limitations of this study, Ti implant coated with
      gamma-radiation-crosslinked collagen has potential utility without side effects
      from chemical agents.

TI  - Superficial Characteristics of Titanium after Treatment of Chorreated Surface,
      Passive Acid, and Decontamination with Argon Plasma.
LID - E71 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jfb9040071 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background. Titanium is characterized by its biocompatibility, resistance to 
      maximum stress, and fatigue and non-toxicity. The composition, surface structure,
      and roughness of titanium have a key and direct influence on the osseointegration
      processes when it is used in the form of dental implants. The objective of the
      present study is to characterize, at chemical, superficial, and biological
      levels, the result of the application of the sandblasted with large-grit and
      acid-etched (SLA) treatment consisting of coarse-grained and double-passivated
      acid blasting with subsequent decontamination with argon plasma on the surface of
      titanium implants type IV. (2) Methods. Four Oxtein((R)) dental implants
      (Zaragoza, Spain) were investigated with the following coding: Code L63713T
      (titanium grade IV, 3.75 mm in diameter, and 13 mm in length). The surface of the
      implants was SLA type obtained from coarse-grained, double passivated acid, and
      decontaminated with argon plasma. The samples were in their sealed packages and
      were opened in our laboratory. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
      technique was used to characterize the chemical composition of the surface, and
      the scanning electronic microscope (SEM) technique was used to perform
      topographic surface evaluation. Cell cultures were also performed on both
      surfaces. (3) Results. The superficial chemical analysis of the studied samples
      presented the following components, approximately, expressed in atomic
      percentage: O: 39%; Ti: 18%; C: 39%; N: 2%; and Si: 1%. In the same way, the
      topographic analysis values were obtained in the evaluated roughness parameters: 
      Ra: 1.5 mum +/- 0.02%; Rq: 1.31 mum +/- 0.33; Rz: 8.98 mum +/- 0.73; Rp: 5.12 mum
      +/- 0.48; Rv: 3.76 mum +/- 0.51; and Rc: 4.92 mum +/- 0.24. At a biological
      level, the expression of osteocalcin was higher (p < 0.05) on the micro-rough
      surface compared to that machined at 48 and 96 h of culture. (4) Conclusions. The
      data obtained in our study indicate that the total carbon content, the relative
      concentration of titanium, and the roughness of the treatment performed on the
      implants are in agreement with those found in the literature. Further, the
      roughness of the treatment performed on the implants throws a spongy,
      three-dimensional surface suitable for bone growth on it. The biological results 
      found are compatible with the clinical use of the surface tested.

TI  - Bone Immune Response to Materials, Part I: Titanium, PEEK and Copper in
      Comparison to Sham at 10 Days in Rabbit Tibia.
LID - E526 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm7120526 [doi]
AB  - Bone anchored biomaterials have become an indispensable solution for the
      restoration of lost dental elements and for skeletal joint replacements. However,
      a thorough understanding is still lacking in terms of the biological mechanisms
      leading to osseointegration and its contrast, unwanted peri-implant bone loss. We
      have previously hypothesized on the participation of immune mechanisms in such
      processes, and later demonstrated enhanced bone immune activation up to 4 weeks
      around titanium implants. The current experimental study explored and compared in
      a rabbit tibia model after 10 days of healing time, the bone
      inflammation/immunological reaction at mRNA level towards titanium, polyether
      ether ketone (PEEK) and copper compared to a Sham control. Samples from the test 
      and control sites were, after a healing period, processed for gene expression
      analysis (polymerase chain reaction, (qPCR)) and decalcified histology tissue
      analysis. All materials displayed immune activation and suppression of bone
      resorption, when compared to sham. The M1 (inflammatory)/M2 (reparative)
      -macrophage phenotype balance was correlated to the proximity and volume of bone 
      growth at the implant vicinity, with titanium demonstrating a M2-phenotype at 10 
      days, whereas copper and PEEK were still dealing with a mixed M1- and
      M2-phenotype environment. Titanium was the only material showing adequate bone
      growth and proximity inside the implant threads. There was a consistent
      upregulation of (T-cell surface glycoprotein CD4) CD4 and downregulation of
      (T-cell transmembrane glycoprotein CD8) CD8, indicating a CD4-lymphocyte
      phenotype driven reaction around all materials at 10 days.

TI  - Evaluation of an Innovative Hybrid Macrogeometry Dental Implant in Immediate
      Extraction Sockets: A Histomorphometric Pilot Study in Foxhound Dogs.
PG  - 29-37
LID - 10.11607/prd.3848 [doi]
AB  - A preclinical pilot study was performed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, primary
      stability, and wound healing of a hybrid dental implant with a unique
      macrogeometry design in which the coronal section is narrower and cylinder-shaped
      followed by a wider, tapered apical portion, each comprising approximately one
      half the length of the implant. Eighteen hybrid macrogeometry-designed dental
      implants were placed bilaterally into three foxhounds in the mandibular third and
      fourth premolar and first molar (P3, P4, and M1, respectively) extraction sockets
      of different dimensions immediately following full periosteal flap elevation and 
      removal of teeth without socket grafting. Bone plate thickness, implant position 
      and depth, gap distance, and insertion torque values were measured following
      implant installation. Surgical sites were healed uneventfully for 3 months, and
      then samples of soft and hard tissues surrounding the implants were retrieved to 
      perform light microscopic and histomorphometric analyses. All 18 implants were
      stable and osseointegrated both clinically and radiographically. The analyses
      revealed that the amount of hard tissue alteration and bone fill that occurred
      during the healing period was significantly influenced by the thickness of the
      bone plate, the size of the horizontal buccal gap, and the implant diameter,
      position, and depth within the extraction socket. The P3 and P4 hybrid implants
      placed approximately 1.0 mm subcrestal from the interproximal height of bone with
      less gap distance (</= 1.0 mm) exhibited minor to modest (1.5 to 2.0 mm) crestal 
      bone remodeling relative to the implant platform. Conversely, M1 implants
      positioned with greater depth (>/= 2.0 mm) and gap distance (>/= 2.0 mm) that
      were evaluated in a buccal-lingual dimension exhibited minimal crestal change
      with first bone-to-implant contact within 1.0 mm (range: 0.00 to 0.89 mm) of the 
      machined-collar surface. The thicker lingual bone plate on all M1 implants was
      relatively maintained and unaffected. The apical half of the implant provided
      high initial stability (range: 65 to 100 Ncm). The mean percentage of
      bone-to-implant contact was 56.34% (range: 40.15% to 72.04%). This preclinical
      study provided clinical and histologic evidence to support the safety and
      efficacy of a new hybrid macrogeometry implant design that achieved excellent
      primary and secondary stability in immediate extraction sockets without grafting.

AB  - To improve initial osteoblast adhesion and subsequent osseointegration, TiO2
      nanotubes layer was constructed on the titanium (Ti) surface by anodic oxidation 
      (AO), with an additional hydroxyapatite (HA) coating to form the AO/HA surface.
      Tests on in vitro cellular activity displayed that the AO surface, especially the
      AO/HA surface, promoted initial adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of
      osteoblast cells. The modified AO and AO/HA surfaces further presented an
      up-regulated gene expression of osteogenic and adhesion markers collagen type 1
      (COL), osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN) and vinculin. In addition, in vivo
      experiments with a rat model demonstrated that the AO surface, particularly the
      AO/HA surface, achieved earlier osseointegration and a superior bone bonding
      ability compared with Ti. Our study shed light on a synergistic role played by
      nanotopography and HA in promoting osteoblast adhesion, proliferation,
      differentiation and osseointegration, thus suggesting a promising method for
      better modifying the implant surface.

AB  - Objective: To compare the clinical outcomes of posterior maxillary implant
      surgery when using the regular transalveolar approach or with the crestal
      approach-sinus (CAS-KIT), a device for maxillary sinus membrane elevation by the 
      crestal approach using a special drilling system and hydraulic pressure. Methods:
      In this retrospective study 887 patients during Jan 2012 to July 2015 in Hangzhou
      Dental Hospital with underwent either regular transalveolar approach or CAS-KIT
      approach for maxillary augmentation; whereas 11 patients dropped out for the
      reason of serious membrane perforations. Totally, 876 patients with 1 204 plants,
      placed immediately after transalveolar maxillary augmentation, were included in
      this study. The data analysis was performed by radiological measures to assess
      the changes in height of maxillary sinus floor after the transalveolar
      augmentation at different time points. In addition, the complications after
      surgery, failure rates, osseointegration condition and the performance of
      rehabilitation were evaluated as well. Results: Five hundred and three patients
      were experienced with regular transalveolar approach, and 7 patients were drop
      out for the serious membrane perforations. Thus, 496 patients received 653
      implants in this group; the average lifted range in maxillary sinus floor height 
      changes was (4.08+/-3.45) mm. The complications were minor membrane perforations 
      during procedure in 64 patients, postoperative maxillary sinus infection
      happening in 2 patients and 13 patients experienced rehabilitation failure. Three
      hundred and eighty-four patients had CAS-KIT approach with 4 patients dropped
      out. Three hundred and eighty patients get 551 implants with the mean lifted
      range of (8.36+/-4.07) mm in maxillary sinus floor height changes. Minor membrane
      perforations during procedure occurred in 31 people and 2 got postoperative
      maxillary sinus infection. The 4 year overall survival rate of 1 204 implants was
      97.26%, with four implants fell off after 3 months of rehabilitation and one
      implant occurred after one year of rehabilitation. Conclusions: The regular
      transalveolar sinus lift technique is easier and time saving, but the compromised
      lifting range in maxillary sinus floor height and the comparatively high
      occurrence of intraoperative membrane perforations should be concerned. Using
      CAS-KIT could be an alternative method to perform maxillary sinus augmentation
      with a reduced incidence of complications. There was no statistically difference 
      in implant failure rates and incidence of postoperative maxillary sinus infection
      between two groups.

TI  - The augment-and-modular-cage revision system for reconstruction of severe
      acetabular defects-two-year clinical and radiographic results.
LID - 10.1007/s00264-018-4271-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Acetabular revision of failed total hip arthroplasty (THA) is often
      associated with severe bone loss. Therefore, a variety of revision implant
      systems has been developed during recent years, with the augment-and-modular-cage
      system being one of the newest additions to this portfolio. Together with
      biologic downsizing by means of impaction bone grafting, this uncemented system
      promises a high modularity and versatility to treat all acetabular defects up to 
      Paprosky types IIIa and IIIb without pelvic discontinuity. The aim of the present
      study was to evaluate first short-term results of its clinical application, both 
      clinical functional and patient-reported as well as radiographic. METHODS:
      Forty-four patients (28 female, 16 male, mean age 70.9 +/- 11.5 years) could be
      followed for a mean of 26 +/- 10 months after acetabular revision with a novel
      augment-and-modular-cage system. Indications for revision included aseptic
      loosening (68%), septic loosening (16%), or others (16%) with bone loss Paprosky 
      IIa up to IIIb without discontinuity. The modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) served
      as a primary outcome parameter. In addition, a number of patient-reported outcome
      measurements (PROMs) were collected including the Short Form 36 (SF-36), Hip
      disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), and Visual Analogue Scale for
      Hip Pain (VAS Hip) as well as overall satisfaction. Radiographic changes between 
      the pre- and postoperative center of rotation (COR) and various criteria of
      implant failure served as secondary outcome parameters. RESULTS: No patients were
      lost to follow-up. Two implant-associated complications (partial flange breakage)
      without a need for revision surgery were detected, which represent a failure rate
      of 4.5%. Functional outcome as measured by mHHS increased from 49.4 +/- 2.9
      pre-operatively to 74.4 +/- 3.1 at the latest follow-up (p < 0.001). PROMs showed
      significant improvements in all pain-related categories, while other
      quality-of-life measurements only exhibited positive tendencies towards
      improvement. VAS Hip significantly improved from 6.5 +/- 0.7 pre-operatively to
      2.2 +/- 0.6 at the latest follow-up (p < 0.001). Radiographic evaluation showed
      that reconstruction of the COR was possible, referenced to the contralateral
      side. The COR could be lateralized by 5.0 mm (n.s.) and caudalized by 10.3 mm (p 
      < 0.001) comparing pre-operative and post-operative states, with complete
      osseointegration in 95% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the
      augment-and-modular-cage system significantly improved clinical functional and
      patient-reported outcomes in cases of acetabular revision after failed THA. In
      addition, a good reconstruction of the COR could also be achieved. Therefore,
      this highly modular system can be considered as an effective treatment option in 
      almost all cases of acetabular bone loss except for those of pelvic
      discontinuity. It offers the unique possibility of intra-operative implant
      customization according to the existing bone defect and host bone quality.

      study.
PG  - 450-464
LID - 10.1177/0269215518815215 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES:: (1) To compare level of function, activity, health-related quality
      of life (HRQoL) and satisfaction in persons with a lower extremity amputation
      before surgery and 6- and 12-months after implantation of an osseointegration
      implant and (2) to report adverse events. DESIGN:: Prospective cohort study.
      SETTING:: University medical centre. SUBJECTS:: A total of 40 consecutive persons
      (median age: 56 years) who received a transfemoral (31) or transtibial (9)
      osseointegration implant, between April 2014 and March 2016. INTERVENTION::
      Osseointegration implant surgery followed by a predefined rehabilitation
      programme. MAIN MEASURES:: Hip abductor strength, prosthetic use, back pain
      frequency, postoperative pain, mobility level (Timed-Up and Go (TUG) and
      wheelchair-boundedness), walking ability (6 minute walking test (6MWT) and
      walking distance in daily life), HRQoL, satisfaction regarding the prosthesis,
      and adverse events. RESULTS:: Strength, prosthetic use, walking distance, HRQoL, 
      and satisfaction level increased significantly at 6- and 12-month follow-up
      compared to baseline ( P 0.002). The TUG showed no change at 6-month follow-up ( 
      P = 0.420) but improved significantly at 12-month follow-up compared to baseline 
      ( P = 0.005). Wheelchair-boundedness decreased from 12/40 participants at
      baseline to 0 at follow-ups. The 6MWT ( P 0.038) and back pain ( P 0.437) did not
      change over time. Stump pain was present in 28/39 and 22/40 of the participants
      at 6-and 12-month follow-up, respectively. The major adverse events were managed 
      successfully and included three dual-cone breakages and four bone fractures. An
      uneventful course was completed by 19/31 transfemoral and 4/9 transtibial
      bone-anchored prostheses users. CONCLUSION:: Bone-anchored prostheses lead to
      improved performance and appear to be safe, so they might be considered for
      persons with socket-related problems.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present long-term data on the Wide Ponto implant bone-anchored
      hearing system (BAHS) in regards to implant stability, soft tissue reaction and
      implant loss for two case series undergone either the tissue reduction- or the
      tissue preservation surgical technique. METHODS: Comparison of two consecutive,
      prospective case series. Each case series enrolled 24 patients. The case series
      underwent one-stage implantation of the Wide Ponto implant BAHS using either a
      linear incision technique with subcutaneous reduction or a linear incision
      technique without subcutaneous reduction. Implant stability quotient (ISQ) values
      were measured using resonance frequency analysis and soft tissue reactions were
      graded according to Holgers' classification system. Follow-up visits were
      performed at 10 days, 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and annually up to 4 years
      (tissue preservation) or 5 years (tissue reduction) postoperatively. RESULTS: The
      two case series had homogenous patient populations and followed an identical
      postoperative scheme. The ISQ values increased consistently the first 12 months
      for both groups (p </= 0.001), and were higher in the tissue preservation case
      series, (p = 0.04, 9 mm abutment). More than 91% of the soft tissue observations 
      were assessed as Holgers' grade 0 or 1. One implant (2.1%) was lost due to
      trauma. CONCLUSION: In both case series, the Wide Ponto implant showed increasing
      implant stability during the follow-up period from the time of surgery,
      irrespective of surgical technique, indicating good osseointegration. Soft tissue
      reactions were rare and of minor severity. Implant survival was high.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the effects of astragaloside IV on
      osteoblastlike cell proliferation and migration, in addition to the underlying
      signaling pathway. In order to observe the effect on proliferation, a Cell
      Counting Kit8 assay and flow cytometry were used. To detect cell migration
      ability, cell scratch and Transwell cell migration assays were performed. The RNA
      and protein expression levels of hedgehog signaling molecules, including Sonic
      hedgehog (SHH) and GLI family zinc finger 1 (GLI1), were examined by reverse
      transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. To
      inhibit the hedgehog signaling pathway, cyclopamine was used. Astragaloside IV,
      at a dosage of 1x102 microg/ml in MG63 cells and 1x103 microg/ml in U2OS cells,
      resulted in the enhanced proliferation and migration of cells, and the gene
      expression levels of the SHH and GLI1 were significantly increased. The
      combination of astragaloside IV and cyclopamine reduced MG63 and U2OS cell
      proliferation and migration, and inhibited the gene expression of SHH and GLI1.
      Astragaloside IV enhanced the proliferation and migration of human osteoblastlike
      cells through activating the hedgehog signaling pathway. The results of the
      present study provide a rational for the mechanistic link in astragaloside IV
      promoting the proliferation and migration of osteoblasts via the hedgehog
      signaling pathway.

TI  - Effect of the laser beam on implant site preparation: a preliminary pilot study.
PG  - 861-867
AB  - The aim of this preliminary study is to histologically evaluate the effects of
      erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) laser on soft and hard tissues
      during implant bed preparation, in comparison with bur and cutter in order to
      observe the following aspects: (i) the shape of the cavity, (ii) the presence of 
      debris, and (iii) structural modification of the cell architecture. Bone
      temperature changes during the preparation of the implant bed were also measured 
      in order to evaluate thermal damage on soft and hard tissues. Er:YAG laser,
      Fotona X-Runner scanner and circular cutter of 5 mm diameter were compared using 
      an in vitro model. Implant bed preparations were performed in bovine rib bone
      (hard tissue) and tongue muscle (soft tissue) tissues. Results of the study show 
      that in all bur samples were present more debris and more blood cells than in
      laser samples, which, according to the rules of healing processes, can be a
      negative factor for the osseointegration process. Regarding the thermal effects
      on soft tissue, they were present when using MAX mode, but absent when using
      quantum square pulse (QSP) mode. A preliminary conclusion emphasizes the use of
      laser to prepare the implant site without debris formation. Nowadays, is not
      still present a laser device that can overtake the technical limitations of the
      laser scanner (i.e., deepness control and scanner movement during the preparation
      of the holes, etc.).

TI  - The evaluation of the morphological evolution of the tissue integration of dental
      implants through conventional histology and immunohistochemistry techniques.
PG  - 851-859
AB  - Soft peri-implant tissues are important to ensure the integration of a dental
      implant, and information on their morphophysiology may explain some clinical
      failures. Through this study, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of
      the behavior of peri-implant soft tissue, the morphological support being the one
      that can explain the different clinical situations. Thus, we sought to reconcile 
      clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) aspects of soft
      peri-implant tissue, in patients who did not show clinical mobility or
      radiological signs of bone resorption four months after insertion of implants,
      some of them showing no clinical signs of inflammation. Immunohistochemically, we
      highlighted the cellular populations participating in the inflammatory process
      present in the peri-implant mucosa, in the two groups of patients. The IHC
      identification of these types of cells and the degree to which each of them was
      represented by the use of monoclonal antibodies can provide additional insight
      into the local response of peri-implant soft tissue in healing and
      osseointegration. This helps the clinician to improve the clinical success of
      dental implant treatment because the soft tissue surrounding the dental implant
      separates the implant from the oral cavity and makes a biological seal that
      prevents the development of the peri-implant pathology. Thus, the soft tissue
      surrounding the dental implants ensures the conditions of osseointegration and
      hence the long-term survival of an implant.

TI  - Osseointegration of zirconium dental implants three months after insertion in
      rabbit femur. Histopathological study.
PG  - 781-786
AB  - Implantology is a highly researched field with a constant concern in finding and 
      studying new implant materials. Lately, zirconium has become a very attractive
      alternative to the detriment of titanium, but the research results were sometimes
      contradictory. Thus, we considered as opportune to study the osseointegration of 
      zirconium dental implants in rabbit femur, three months after insertion. The
      biological material was represented by five rabbits and the experimental protocol
      was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Oradea, Romania. The
      implants (zirconium ceramic dental implants: 5 mm length, 2.6 mm diameter) were
      inserted in the femur under controlled conditions, after creating a bone defect. 
      The animals received the appropriate postoperative care. Three months later, the 
      implantation area was harvested and processed for histological examination. The
      assessment of the osseointegration process of the zirconium implants showed that 
      they were very well tolerated by the host organism that did not trigger any
      rejection processes. Approximately 80% of the compromised bone was replaced with 
      newly formed bone in advanced stages of remodeling and consolidation. The
      proliferated bone near the implants acquired a structure similar to the rabbit
      diaphyseal bone, but with higher density and size of the osteons. The stage
      reached by the osseointegration process three months after the insertion of the
      implants, ensures a good consolidation of the implants that supports the
      prosthetic structures, which are to be built on them.

TI  - Rehabilitations of a single element with one-piece implants with electrowelded
      needles: A different approach.
PG  - 447-452
AB  - To ensure single dental implant stability, there are some approaches. The
      stabilization of a single-piece implant by welding it to a titanium needle allows
      immediate loading and promotes the final osseointegration. The aim of this case
      report study was an evaluation of long-term clinical outcomes of immediate
      loading in cases with bone atrophy in the canine region by welding single implant
      to a titanium needle. In two cases with maxillary atrophic anterior bone,
      single-piece titanium implants were used. As support structure, a Scialom-type
      stabilization titanium needle was used (diameter 1.2 mm and suitable length to
      obtain a bicortical positioning). These two elements were joined together using a
      Mondani intraoral welder. The implants immediately loaded by temporary
      restorations. The cases were followed for 24 years, and clinical outcomes were
      assessed. The use of this method, in the cases with maxillary atrophic anterior
      bone, allows immediate loading with a fixed acrylic prosthesis at the end of the 
      surgical session. Clinical outcome was successful for 24 years. This approach is 
      a successful method that allows immediate loading in atrophic bone.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A variety of biodegradable implants (screws, rods, plates and
      cages) are available which are composed of many different biodegradable polymers 
      with varying characteristics. The present review of animal and clinical studies
      examines the efficacy and safety of biodegradable implants in spinal fracture
      intervention. METHODS: A review of the literature through March 2018 was
      performed using PubMed and Cochrane databases. Success rates were calculated
      according to sufficient tissue biocompatibility, solid clinical fusion and
      propensity for osseointegration. RESULTS: 49 articles (24 animal and 25 human
      studies) were included. In animal experiments, the overall success rate for
      spinal fusion was 60.3%, while the mean success rate regarding the cervical spine
      was 51.8% compared to 68.1% for the lumbar spine (p = 0.002). In studies
      involving control group(s): the mean bioabsorbable implant success rate for
      spinal fusion was 42% compared to 57% for conventional implants (p = 0.0016). In 
      the lumbar spine pL-lactide acid (PLLA) had 75.2% success rate compared to poly
      (L-lactide-co-DL-lactide) (PLDLLA) at 53.4% (p = 0.003). In clinical studies, the
      overall mean success rate was 89%, while the mean success rate regarding the
      cervical spine was 92%, as compared to 83.6% for the lumbar spine (p = 0.001). In
      studies involving control group(s): the mean bioabsorbable implant success rate
      was 75% compared to a conventional implant mean success rate of 97% (p<0.0001).
      In the cervical spine PLLA had a 98.7% success rate compared to 90% with PLDLLA
      (p = 0.015). In the lumbar spine PLDLLA had 84.7% success rate compared to 63.6% 
      for poly-glycolic acid (PGA) (p = 0.085). DISCUSSION: Studies combined
      biodegradable and conventional implants. Polymers were used in various
      combinations and surface modification of the implants also varied. Comparison
      studies were of small sample size. Animal and clinical studies diverged. The
      current data are not encouraging. The end-point of assessing osseointegration
      varies in the studies and is indeterminate. In early stages the structure
      comparison of osseous restoration using biodegradable implants appears inferior
      to utilization of conventional cages and instrumentation. There is no
      statistically significant evidence supporting the efficacy of biodegradable
      implants replacing traditional instrumentation. There is a lack of prospective
      clinical trials with long-term follow-up regarding utilization of biodegradable
      implants and the available data does not support their routine use in spinal

TI  - Regenerated Bone Pattern Around Exposed Implants with Various Designs.
PG  - 61-67
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6715 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The design and surface features of dental implants substantially affect 
      the healing and remodeling of adjacent bones. This study aimed to investigate the
      impact of design and surface on bone regeneration using implants of two different
      pitches, each with three different surface features. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Custom-manufactured titanium implants (length, 10 mm; diameter, 3.5 mm) were
      divided along the major axis into two sections: one with 0.6-mm pitch and the
      other with 0.4-mm pitch. They were processed by turned, blasting and etching, and
      anodic oxidation surface treatments and implanted into rabbit tibia. The upper 4 
      mm of the inserted implants was exposed, and bone regeneration was induced around
      the exposed area using a titanium chamber (height: 4 mm) containing particulate
      autogenous and bovine bone. After a 12-week healing period, the quantity and
      quality of bone regeneration around the implants were evaluated. Thirty
      specimens-10 specimens each from the turned, blasting and etching, and anodic
      oxidation surface groups with 0.6- and 0.4-mm pitch sizes- were evaluated by
      histomophometric analysis. RESULTS: The vertical height and width of regenerated 
      bone around blasting and etching and anodic oxidation surfaces were significantly
      greater than those around turned implants (P < .05); the vertical heights of
      regenerated bone around the 0.4-mm-pitch sections of blasting and etching and
      anodic oxidation surfaces were significantly greater than those around the
      0.6-mm-pitch sections (P < .05). Both blasting and etching and anodic oxidation
      surfaces exhibited significantly greater bone-to-implant contact and bone volume 
      at the implant thread than turned implants (P < .05). However, there was no
      significant difference between the 0.6- and 0.4-mm-pitch sections. CONCLUSION:
      The findings of this study indicate that blasting and etching and anodic
      oxidation surfaces with a 0.4-mm-pitch design result in greater vertical ingrowth
      of regenerated bone than those with a 0.6-mm-pitch design.

TI  - Alveolar Ridge Expansion: Comparison of Osseodensification and Conventional
      Osteotome Techniques.
PG  - 607-610
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000004956 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this in vivo study is to compare the osseointegration of
      endosteal implants placed in atrophic mandibular alveolar ridges with alveolar
      ridge expansion surgical protocol via an experimental osseodensification drilling
      versus conventional osteotome technique. METHODS: Twelve endosteal implants, 4 mm
      x 13 mm, were placed in porcine models in horizontally atrophic mandibular ridges
      subsequent to prior extraction of premolars. Implants were placed with
      osseodensification drilling technique as the experimental group (n = 6) and
      osteotome site preparation as the control group (n = 6). After 4 weeks of
      healing, samples were retrieved and stained with Stevenel's Blue and Van Gieson's
      Picro Fuschin for histologic evaluation. Quantitative analysis via
      bone-to-implant contact (BIC%) and bone area fraction occupancy (BAFO%) were
      obtained as mean values with corresponding 95% confidence interval. A significant
      omnibus test, post-hoc comparison of the 2 drilling techniques' mean values was
      accomplished using a pooled estimate of the standard error with P-value set at
      0.05. RESULTS: The mean BIC% value was approximately 62.5% in the
      osseodensification group, and 31.4% in the regular instrumentation group.
      Statistical analysis showed a significant effect of the drilling technique (P =
      0.018). There was no statistical difference in BAFO as a function of drilling
      technique (P = 0.198). CONCLUSION: The combined osseodensification
      drilling-alveolar ridge expansion technique showed increased evidence of
      osseointegration and implant primary stability from a histologic and
      biomechanical standpoint, respectively. Future studies will focus on expanding
      the sample size as well as the timeline of the study to allow investigation of
      long-term prognosis of this novel technique.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe the surgical technique of
      immediate dental implant placement in calvarial grafts for augmentation of the
      severely resorbed maxilla and to assess the treatment results. METHODS: In 13
      patients the maxilla was augmented with calvarial bone followed by simultaneous
      dental implant placement (total: 68 implants). In the frontal "knife edge"
      region, implants were inserted in the buccal plated area. In the maxillary sinus 
      area, implants were inserted into alveolar bone that was plated buccally or
      palatally through the sinus window. After 4 months, the implants were retrieved
      and subsequently loaded. Per-operative and post-operative variables were scored. 
      One bone biopsy sample was taken for histological analysis. RESULTS: The surgical
      procedure and wound healing was uneventful. During abutment connection after 4
      months, all implants were fully osseointegrated with no signs of graft
      resorption. Radiographically, the mean (+/-SD) peri-implant bone loss after 1
      year of functional loading was 0.23 +/- 0.44 mm. No implants were lost.
      Histological examination revealed vital calvarial and maxillary bone with active 
      remodeling. CONCLUSION: Immediate dental implant placement in calvarial bone
      grafts to rehabilitate severely resorbed maxilla is technically feasible and
      seems to have a high success rate.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Roughened dental implants promote mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs)
      osteoblastic differentiation, and hydrophilic modifications induce
      anti-inflammatory macrophages activation. While the effect of different surface
      modifications on osseointegration of commercial dental implants have been
      compared in vivo and clinically, the initial cellular response to these
      modifications often overlooked. We aimed to characterize the macrophage
      inflammatory response and MSC osteogenesis across different commercially
      available implants in vitro. METHODS: Six commercially available rough implants
      [OsseoSpeed (Astra-Tech, Implant A); Osseotite((R)) (Biomet 3i, Implant B);
      TiUnite (Nobel-Biocare((R)), Implant C); Ti-SLA((R)), (Implant D), Roxolid((R))
      (RXD-SLA, Implant E), RXD-SLActive((R)) (Implant F) (Straumann((R)))] were
      examined. Macrophages and MSCs were seeded directly on implants and cultured in
      custom vials. mRNA and protein levels of pro- (IL1B, IL6, IL17A, CXCL10, TNFa)
      and anti- (IL4, IL10, TGFB1) inflammatory markers were measured after 24 and 48h 
      in macrophages. Osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs was assessed after seven
      days by alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin, and angiogenic, osteogenic,
      and inflammatory markers by ELISA and qPCR (n=6/variable, ANOVA, post hoc Tukey
      HSD with alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Hydrophilic implant F induced the highest level of
      osteogenic factor released from MSCs and anti-inflammatory factors from
      macrophages with the lowest level of pro-inflammatory factors. Alternatively,
      implants A and C supported lower levels of osteogenesis and increased secretion
      of pro-inflammatory factors. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we successfully
      evaluated differences in cell response to commercially available clinical
      implants using an in vitro model. Data from this model suggest that not all
      surface modification procedures generate the same cell response.

TI  - Radiolucency around highly porous sockets and hydroxyapatite-coated porous
      sockets in total hip arthroplasty for hip dysplasia.
PG  - 611-618
LID - 10.1007/s00590-018-2351-3 [doi]
AB  - Studies over the past decade have reported that the use of highly porous sockets 
      in total hip arthroplasty (THA) results in osseointegration and long-term implant
      stability. However, some reports have raised concerns regarding radiographic
      evidence of poor osseointegration with features of fibrous tissue ingrowth. The
      purpose of this study was to compare clinical and radiographic assessments of
      highly porous sockets with those of hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated porous sockets in 
      THA for hip dysplasia (DDH) at least 1 year after surgery. A total of 127
      patients (136 hips) were recruited for the study. Of these, 94 patients (101
      hips) received highly porous sockets with clustered screws, while 33 patients (35
      hips) received HA-coated porous sockets with clustered screws. There was no
      difference in clinical outcomes between the two types of sockets. All HA-coated
      porous sockets were radiographically stable, without radiolucent lines. Fifteen
      hips had radiolucent lines in two or three DeLee and Charnley zones, accompanied 
      by sclerotic lines along the circumferences of the highly porous sockets. A
      significant difference in the height of the preoperative osteophyte of the
      anterior acetabular wall was observed between 86 hips with one or no radiolucent 
      lines and 15 hips with two or three radiolucent lines. In cases of DDH with
      atrophic bone remodeling pattern, highly porous sockets with multiple screws may 
      be used, while HA-coated porous sockets with clustered screws result in better
      sealing of the bone-component interface.

TI  - Ligature-Induced Experimental Peri-Implantitis-A Systematic Review.
LID - E492 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm7120492 [doi]
AB  - This systematic review sought to analyze different experimental peri-implantitis 
      models, their potential to induce marginal bone resorption (MBR) and the
      necessity of bacteria for bone loss to occur in these models. An electronic
      search in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect was undertaken. A
      total of 133 studies were analyzed. Most studies induced peri-implantitis with
      ligatures that had formed a biofilm, sometimes in combination with inoculation of
      specific bacteria but never in a sterile environment. Most vertical MBR resulted 
      from new ligatures periodically packed above old ones, followed by periodically
      exchanged ligatures and ligatures that were not exchanged. Cotton ligatures
      produced the most MBR, followed by steel, "dental floss" (not further specified
      in the studies) and silk. The amount of MBR varied significantly between
      different animal types and implant surfaces. None of the analyzed ligature
      studies aimed to validate that bacteria are necessary for the inducement of MBR. 
      It cannot be excluded that bone loss can be achieved by other factors of the
      model, such as an immunological reaction to the ligature itself or trauma from
      repeated ligature insertions. Because all the included trials allowed plaque
      accumulation on the ligatures, bone resorbing capacity due to other factors could
      not be excluded or evaluated here.

TI  - Atomic layout of an orthodontic titanium mini-implant in human tissue: Insights
      into the possible mechanisms during osseointegration.
PG  - 292-298
LID - 10.2319/051418-354.1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES:: To evaluate nanoscale molecular interactions in the interface
      between human bone and orthodontic titanium implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: An 
      orthodontic implant (sandblasted with large grit and with an acid-etched surface 
      treated with Ti6A14V alloy) retrieved from the mandible of human after 2 months
      of healing was used to analyze the molecular interactive mechanism between the
      implant and the surrounding bone tissue. To preserve the natural state of the
      sample as much as possible, cryofixation and scanning electron microscope/focused
      ion beam milling without any chemical treatment were used during sample
      preparation. Atom probe tomography was used to investigate the chemical
      composition and structure at the interface between the implant and human bone
      tissue. RESULTS:: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the whole sample
      revealed a 20 x 50-nm(2) plate-like bony element diffusion layer in the sample.
      The iso concentration analysis of the diffusion layer indicated that the bony
      element, calcium, and the implant element, titanium oxide, were interspersed with
      each other. Detailed ionic distribution was illustrated by 3D reconstruction with
      partial region of interest and one-dimensional concentration profiles of the
      implant-bone interface. CONCLUSIONS:: The study results advance nanoscale
      understanding of osseointegration and suggest a potential nanostructure for
      increasing bond strength of biomaterials to bone.

TI  - A Step-by-Step Procedure for Bone Regeneration Using Calcium Phosphate Scaffolds:
      From Site Preparation to Graft Placement.
PG  - 149-153
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000004996 [doi]
AB  - Hydroxyapatite (HA) is the main mineral component of bone and teeth. HA is often 
      used as a bone substitute and especially in its granular form it is
      osteoconductive and osseointegrating as shown by many investigations in animals
      and humans. HA granules are used for filling bone defects, but they have poor
      handling qualities and retention at the surgical site, leading to graft voids
      between the granules and bone tissue and resulting in mechanical instability.
      Furthermore HA implantation is not constantly followed by favorable results,
      especially when it is carried out for augmentation of the alveolar ridge. This
      article offers a protocol for bone reconstruction and predictable implant
      treatment outcomes. We provide a step-by-step description of both the recipient
      site and composite graft preparations using coralline HA granules (CHAG) and
      homologous fibrin glue (HFG). In the present study, 20 randomly selected patients
      (12 women and 8 men) underwent bone regeneration using CHAG-HFG before a dental
      implant procedure. Radiographic imaging, physical examination, and histological
      analysis were performed during a 2-year period. Biopsies were obtained at
      second-stage surgery before implant insertion using a 2.8-mm trephine bur. A
      morphological study of 20 bioptic human specimens was performed. Our results
      demonstrate that this surgical protocol for the preparation of the recipient site
      associated with a mixture of coralline HA granules with homologous fibrin glue
      provides reliable bone regeneration, thus reducing failures and minimizing risks 
      of postoperative morbidity.

TI  - Transcriptomic profiling of tantalum metal implant osseointegration in osteopenic
      patients.
PG  - 17042
LID - 10.1038/s41405-018-0004-6 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: The long-term success of dental implants is established by
      literature. Although clinically well defined, the complex genetic pathways
      underlying osseointegration have not yet been fully elucidated. Furthermore,
      patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis are considered to present as higher risk
      for implant failure. Porous tantalum trabecular metal (PTTM), an open-cell porous
      biomaterial, is suggested to present enhanced biocompatibility and
      osteoconductivity. The goal of this study was to evaluate the expression patterns
      of a panel of genes closely associated with osteogenesis and wound healing in
      osteopenic patients receiving either traditional titanium (Ti) or PTTM cylinders 
      to assess the pathway of genes activation in the early phases of
      osseointegration. Material and methods: Implant cylinders made of Ti and PTTM
      were placed in osteopenic volunteers. At 2- and 4 weeks of healing, one Ti and
      one PTTM cylinder were removed from each subject for RT-PCR analysis using
      osteogenesis PCR array. Results: Compared to Ti, PTTM-associated bone displayed
      upregulation of bone matrix proteins, BMP/TGF tisuperfamily, soluble ligand and
      integrin receptors, growth factors, and collagen genes at one or both time
      points. Histologically, PTTM implants displayed more robust osteogenesis
      deposition and maturity when compared to Ti implants from the same patient.
      Conclusions: Our results indicate that PTTM properties could induce an earlier
      activation of genes associated with osteogenesis in osteopenic patients
      suggesting that PTTM implants may attenuate the relative risk of placing dental
      implants in this population.

AB  - PURPOSE: Insufficient bone volume compromises the success rate and
      osseointegration of immediate implantation. The objective of the present study
      was to engineer bone tissue by using adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) sheets and
      autologous platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) to enhance new bone formation and
      osseointegration around dental implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The proliferation 
      and osteogenic potential of ASCs treated with autologous PRF were evaluated with 
      CCK-8 assays, alkaline phosphatase staining, and real-time quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction. A 3-wall bone defect around each immediate implant was
      generated in the mandible and randomly treated with ASC sheets plus PRF (group
      A), ASC sheets only (group B), PRF only (group C), or no treatment (group D).
      Micro-computed tomography, biomechanical tests, fluorescent bone labeling, and
      histologic assessments were performed to evaluate bone regeneration capacity.
      RESULTS: The proliferation and osteogenic potential of canine ASCs were markedly 
      enhanced by PRF. Group A exhibited considerably more new bone formation and
      re-osseointegration (41.17 +/- 1.44 and 55.06 +/- 0.06%, respectively) than did
      the other 3 groups. Fluorescent labeling showed that the most rapid bone
      remodeling activity occurred in group A (P < .05). CONCLUSION: These results
      suggest that sheets of ASC combined with autologous PRF could be a promising
      tissue-engineering strategy for bone formation in immediate implantation.

TI  - Balancing biofunctional and biomechanical properties using porous titanium
      reinforced by carbon nanotubes.
PG  - 719-731
LID - 10.1002/jbm.a.36586 [doi]
AB  - Despite the well-known advantages of the titanium-based implant systems, they
      still lack an optimal balance between biofunctionality and mechanical strength,
      especially regarding the modulation of cellular response and a desired implant
      osseointegration. In this work, we fabricated a nanocomposite based on porous
      commercially pure grade 4 titanium (c.p. Ti) reinforced with carbon nanotubes
      (CNT) at 5% and 10% w/w, with the aim of obtaining a nanocomposite with lower
      stiffness compared to traditional titanium-based implants and with the mechanical
      strength and bioactivity owed by the CNT. Results obtained by scanning electron
      microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy
      characterization showed that the CNT dispersed and incorporated into the porous
      c.p. Ti matrix. Interestingly, CNT were associated with a higher twining within
      neighbor Ti grains, which was indeed consistent with an increased in
      nano-hardness. Biological evaluation by MTT and Comet assay revealed that the
      nanocomposites did not induce genotoxicity and cytotoxicity on two different
      cells lines despite the presence of nickel at the surface. Accordingly, a
      purification step would be required before these CNT can be used for biomedical
      applications. Our results indicate that incorporation of CNT into porous c.p. Ti 
      is a promising avenue to achieve an adequate balance between biofunctionality and
      mechanical strength in Ti-based scaffolds for tissue replacement. (c) 2018 Wiley

TI  - Crestal bone loss around dental implants placed in head and neck cancer patients 
      treated with different radiotherapy techniques: a prospective cohort study.

AB  - The aim of this prospective cohort study was to evaluate how the radiation
      technique can affect crestal bone loss and the implant survival rate in head and 
      neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. In this study, the type of
      radiotherapy treatment, i.e. three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or
      intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), was the predictor variable. The
      primary outcome variable was crestal bone loss, recorded at implant placement and
      after 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. A descriptive analysis and ANOVA test were
      performed; significance was set at P<0.05. Thirty-two patients were enrolled and 
      a total of 113 dental implants placed in irradiated residual bone. There was no
      statistically significant difference in crestal bone loss levels between the
      groups at any of the intervals (P>0.05), except after 6 months (P=0.028). The
      cumulative dental implant survival rate was 94.7%. After 24 months, the mean
      marginal bone loss was 0.83+/-0.12mm in the 3D-CRT group and 0.74+/-0.15mm in the
      IMRT group (P=0.179). The data suggest that the different radiation techniques
      did not affect the outcomes of implant-supported prosthetic rehabilitation, as
      related to crestal bone loss and implant survival. However, long-term follow-up
      studies are necessary to evaluate the real influence of the radiotherapy
      technique on dental implants.

      literature with a case report.

LID - 10.1186/s40729-018-0148-0 [doi]
AB  - Bone fragility and skeletal irregularities are the characteristic features of
      osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Many patients with OI have weakened maxillary and
      mandibular bone, leading to poor oral hygiene and subsequent loss of teeth.
      Improvements in implant therapy have allowed for OI patients to achieve dental
      restoration. However, there is limited available literature on implant therapy
      for patients with OI. The greatest challenge in the restoration process for OI
      patients in an outpatient setting is ensuring primary stability and
      osseointegration. Improvements in synthetic grafts improve successful implant
      placement and prevent predisposing patients to unnecessary procedures. This
      report details the successful restoration process of an OI type I patient's
      maxillary arch in addition to a review of the currently available literature.

TI  - [Selective laser sintering and performances of porous titanium implants].
PG  - 532-538
LID - 10.7518/hxkq.2018.05.013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This work aims to analyze the mechanical properties and
      biocompatibility of porous titanium (Ti) implants fabricated by selective laser
      sintering (SLS) and investigate the promotion of osseointegration by porous
      titanium implant combined with chitosan (CS)/hydroxyapatite(HA) composite
      coating. METHODS: Ti6Al4V specimens were prepared, and CS/HA composite coating
      was fabricated on the surface of a portion of the specimens. The mechanical
      properties of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscope. MC3T3-E1
      cells were cultured in vitro, and their biological properties in vitro were
      analyzed using live and dead viability cell staining method, methyl thiazolyl
      tetrazolium (MTT) staining, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level detection. The
      thread implant specimens were implanted in the femoral condyle of rabbits, and
      biological performance was evaluated in vivo. RESULTS: Quasi-elastic gradient of 
      porous specimens decreased with increasing porosity, and the quasi-elastic
      gradient were close to cortical and cancellous bone when the porosities were 30% 
      and 70%. The specimens showed good biocompatibility. Combined with CS/HA coating,
      the implants promoted the proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and
      facilitated the entry of bone tissue into pores and good osteogenesis.
      CONCLUSIONS: The porous titanium implant exhibited favorable mechanical
      properties and biocompatibility. Combined with CS/HA coating, the implant
      exhibited bone inducibility, which leads to stable osteogenesis.

TI  - Porous titanium-coated polyetheretherketone implants exhibit an improved
      bone-implant interface: an in vitro and in vivo biochemical, biomechanical, and
      histological study.
PG  - 391-402
LID - 10.2147/MDER.S180482 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Spinal interbody fusion cages are designed to provide immediate
      stabilization for adjoining vertebrae and ideally enable bony ingrowth to achieve
      successful integration. For such an implant, cells must be able to attach, move, 
      grow, and differentiate on its surface. These cellular interactions are dependent
      on how the implant surface enables the coating and binding of blood and tissue
      fluid proteins that support cell adhesion. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the in vitro and in vivo osteoblast cell-implant surface interactions
      that result in osseointegration onto a surface composed of plasma-sprayed
      titanium on a polyetheretherketone (PEEK) substrate or titanium-coated PEEK
      (Ti-PEEK) (Plasmapore(XP(R))) as compared to uncoated PEEK implants. Materials
      and methods: The influence of the Ti-PEEK surface modification on the
      biochemical, biomechanical, and histological properties at the bone-implant
      interface is demonstrated both in vitro using simulated bone-forming cell culture
      experiments and in vivo using a 12- and 24-week ovine implant model. Results:
      Osteoblast-like cells attached to the Ti-PEEK surface upregulated early
      bone-forming activity as measured by an increase in transcription and translation
      of ALP and BMP-2 when compared to cells on PEEK. Similarly, a significant
      increase in new bone formation, bony apposition, and pullout strength was
      demonstrated on Ti-PEEK implants when compared to PEEK implants at 12 and 24
      weeks in an ovine implant in vivo model. Conclusion: The study shows that the
      Ti-PEEK surface demonstrated enhanced osseointegrative properties compared to
      PEEK both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - The Influence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus on the Osseointegration of Titanium
      Implants With Different Surface Modifications-A Histomorphometric Study in
      High-Fat Diet/Low-Dose Streptozotocin-Treated Rats.
PG  - 11-19
LID - 10.1097/ID.0000000000000836 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a systemic disease that also
      compromises the bone healing capacity. In healthy individuals, surface
      modifications of dental implants are proven to increase bone response and implant
      success. The aim of this study was to clarify if the surface modifications also
      improve osseointegration in a setting with diabetes mellitus. METHODS: T2DM was
      induced in 7 rats by a high-fat diet/low-dose streptozotocin injection. All
      animals received a hydroxyapatite (HA) implant, a sandblasted and acid-etched
      (SLA) implant, and a standard machined titanium implant for control in the tibia.
      After 4 weeks, thin-ground sections were produced, and the volume of new bone
      formation (nBV/TV) and bone-to-implant contact (nB.I/Im.I) were
      histomorphometrically analyzed. RESULTS: Both surface modifications led to an
      increase of osseointegration compared with the machined surface implant in rats
      with T2DM. nBV/TV was highest in the SLA implants, whereas nB.I/Im.I was highest 
      in the HA group. Regardless of the surface modification, a superordinate regional
      pattern of new bone formation over the length of the implant was observed.
      CONCLUSIONS: Implants with HA coating and SLA surface modifications seem to have 
      the potential to increase osseointegration also in T2DM rats when compared with a
      conventional machined surface.

TI  - VEGF-A regulates angiogenesis during osseointegration of Ti implants via
      paracrine/autocrine regulation of osteoblast response to hierarchical
      microstructure of the surface.

AB  - Establishment of a patent vasculature at the bone-implant interface plays a
      significant role in determining overall success of orthopedic and dental
      implants. Osteoblasts produce vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), an
      important regulator of angiogenesis during bone formation and healing, and the
      amount secreted is sensitive to titanium (Ti) surface microtopography and surface
      energy. The purpose of this study was to determine if surface properties modulate
      cellular response to VEGF-A. MG63 osteoblast-like cells were transfected with
      shRNA targeting VEGF-A at >80% knockdown. Cells stably silenced for VEGF-A
      secreted reduced levels of osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin, FGF-2, and
      angiopoietin-1 when cultured on grit-blasted/acid-etched (SLA) and hydrophilic
      SLA (modSLA) Ti surfaces and conditioned media from these cultures caused reduced
      angiogenesis in an endothelial tubule formation assay. Treatment of MG63 cells
      with 20 ng/mL rhVEGF-A165 rescued production in silenced cells and increased
      production of osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin, FGF-2, and angiopoietin-1, with
      greatest effects on control cells cultured on modSLA. Addition of a
      neutralization antibody against VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2; Flk-1) resulted in a
      significant increase in VEGF-A production. Overall, this study indicates that
      VEGF-A has two roles in osseointegration: enhanced angiogenesis and an
      autocrine/paracrine role in maturation of osteoblast-like cells in response to Ti
      surface properties. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A:

AB  - Complex physical and chemical interactions take place in the interface between
      the implant surface and bone. Various descriptions of the ultrastructural
      arrangement to various implant design features, ranging from solid and
      macroporous geometries to surface modifications on the micron-, submicron-, and
      nano- levels, have been put forward. Here, the current knowledge regarding
      structural organisation of the bone-implant interface is reviewed with a focus on
      solid devices, mainly metal (or alloy) intended for permanent anchorage in bone. 
      Certain biomaterials that undergo surface and bulk degradation are also
      considered. The bone-implant interface is a heterogeneous zone consisting of
      mineralised, partially mineralised, and unmineralised areas. Within the
      meso-micro-nano-continuum, mineralised collagen fibrils form the structural basis
      of the bone-implant interface, in addition to accumulation of non-collagenous
      macromolecules such as osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin. In the
      published literature, as many as eight distinct arrangements of the bone-implant 
      interface ultrastructure have been described. The interpretation is influenced by
      the in vivo model and species-specific characteristics, healing time point(s),
      physico-chemical properties of the implant surface, implant geometry, sample
      preparation route(s) and associated artefacts, analytical technique(s) and their 
      limitations, and non-compromised vs compromised local tissue conditions. The
      understanding of the ultrastructure of the interface under experimental
      conditions is rapidly evolving due to the introduction of novel techniques for
      sample preparation and analysis. Nevertheless, the current understanding of the
      interface zone in humans in relation to clinical implant performance is still
      hampered by the shortcomings of clinical methods for resolving the finer details 
      of the bone-implant interface. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Being a hierarchical
      material by design, the overall strength of bone is governed by composition and
      structure. Understanding the structure of the bone-implant interface is essential
      in the development of novel bone repair materials and strategies, and their
      long-term success. Here, the current knowledge regarding the eventual structural 
      organisation of the bone-implant interface is reviewed, with a focus on solid
      devices intended for permanent anchorage in bone, and certain biomaterials that
      undergo surface and bulk degradation. The bone-implant interface is a
      heterogeneous zone consisting of mineralised, partially mineralised, and
      unmineralised areas. Within the meso-micro-nano-continuum, mineralised collagen
      fibrils form the structural basis of the bone-implant interface, in addition to
      accumulation of non-collagenous macromolecules such as osteopontin, bone
      sialoprotein, and osteocalcin.

TI  - Low serum vitamin D and early dental implant failure: Is there a connection? A
      retrospective clinical study on 1740 implants placed in 885 patients.
PG  - 174-182
LID - 10.15171/joddd.2018.027 [doi]
AB  - Background. Since osseointegration depends on bone metabolism, low levels of
      vitamin D in the blood may negatively affect bone formation around dental
      implants. To date, only a few studies have investigated the possible connection
      between serum levels of vitamin D and early dental implant failure (EDIF), i.e.
      failure that occurs within 4 months after placement, before the connection of the
      prosthetic abutment. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a 
      relationship between low serum levels of vitamin D and EDIF. Methods. Data used
      for this retrospective study were derived from the records of a private dental
      clinic. Inclusion criteria were patients who had been treated with dental
      implants, inserted with a submerged technique from January 2003 to December 2017.
      EDIF was the outcome of this study. Chi-squared test was used to investigate the 
      effect of patient-related variables (age, gender, smoking habit, history of
      periodontal disease and serum levels of vitamin D) on EDIF. Results. Originally, 
      885 patients treated with 1,740 fixtures were enrolled in this study. Overall, 35
      EDIFs (3.9%) were reported. No correlation was found between EDIF and the
      patients' gender (P=0.998), age (P=0.832), smoking habit (P=0.473) or history of 
      periodontal disease (P=0.386). Three EDIFs (11.1%) were reported in 27 patients
      with serum levels of vitamin D <10 ng/mL, 20 EDIFs (4.4%) in 448 patients with
      levels between 10 and 30 ng/mL, and 12 EDIFs (2.9%) in 410 patients with levels
      >30 ng/mL. Although there was a clear trend toward an increased incidence of EDIF
      with lowering of serum vitamin D levels, no statistically significant difference 
      (P=0.105) was found among these three groups. Conclusion. Within its limitations 
      (retrospective design, low number of patients with severe blood levels of vitamin
      D enrolled), this study failed to demonstrate a significant relationship between 
      low serum levels of vitamin D and increased risk of EDIF. However, since a
      dramatic increase in EDIFs with lowering of vitamin D levels in the blood has
      been reported, further clinical studies with appropriate design (prospective or
      randomized controlled studies on a larger sample of severely deficient patients) 
      are needed to better investigate this topic.

TI  - Synergistic effect of surface phosphorylation and micro-roughness on enhanced
      osseointegration ability of poly(ether ether ketone) in the rabbit tibia.
PG  - 16887
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-35313-7 [doi]
AB  - This study was aimed to investigate the osseointegration ability of poly(ether
      ether ketone) (PEEK) implants with modified surface roughness and/or surface
      chemistry. The roughened surface was prepared by a sandblast method, and the
      phosphate groups on the substrates were modified by a two-step chemical reaction.
      The in vitro osteogenic activity of rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the
      developed substrates was assessed by measuring cell proliferation, alkaline
      phosphatase activity, osteocalcin expression, and bone-like nodule formation.
      Surface roughening alone did not improve MSC responses. However, phosphorylation 
      of smooth substrates increased cell responses, which were further elevated in
      combination with surface roughening. Moreover, in a rabbit tibia implantation
      model, this combined surface modification significantly enhanced the
      bone-to-implant contact ratio and corresponding bone-to-implant bonding strength 
      at 4 and 8 weeks post-implantation, whereas modification of surface roughness or 
      surface chemistry alone did not. This study demonstrates that combination of
      surface roughness and chemical modification on PEEK significantly promotes cell
      responses and osseointegration ability in a synergistic manner both in vitro and 
      in vivo. Therefore, this is a simple and promising technique for improving the
      poor osseointegration ability of PEEK-based orthopedic/dental implants.

TI  - Potential Causes of Titanium Particle and Ion Release in Implant Dentistry: A
      Systematic Review.
LID - E3585 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms19113585 [doi]
AB  - Implant surface characteristics, as well as physical and mechanical properties,
      are responsible for the positive interaction between the dental implant, the bone
      and the surrounding soft tissues. Unfortunately, the dental implant surface does 
      not remain unaltered and changes over time during the life of the implant. If
      changes occur at the implant surface, mucositis and peri-implantitis processes
      could be initiated; implant osseointegration might be disrupted and bone
      resorption phenomena (osteolysis) may lead to implant loss. This systematic
      review compiled the information related to the potential sources of titanium
      particle and ions in implant dentistry. Research questions were structured in the
      Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) framework. PICO
      questionnaires were developed and an exhaustive search was performed for all the 
      relevant studies published between 1980 and 2018 involving titanium particles and
      ions related to implant dentistry procedures. Preferred Reporting Items for
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed for the
      selection and inclusion of the manuscripts in this review. Titanium particle and 
      ions are released during the implant bed preparation, during the implant
      insertion and during the implant decontamination. In addition, the implant
      surfaces and restorations are exposed to the saliva, bacteria and chemicals that 
      can potentially dissolve the titanium oxide layer and, therefore, corrosion
      cycles can be initiated. Mechanical factors, the micro-gap and fluorides can also
      influence the proportion of metal particles and ions released from implants and
      restorations.

AB  - Titanium (Ti) biomaterials have been applied to a wide range of implantable
      medical devices. When placed in bone marrow, Ti-biomaterials integrate to the
      surrounding bone tissue by mechanisms that are not fully understood. We have
      previously identified an unexpected upregulation of circadian clock molecule
      neuronal PAS domain 2 (Npas2) in successfully integrated implant with a rough
      surface. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of
      osseointegration through determining the role of Npas2. Human bone marrow stromal
      cells (BMSC) that were cultured on a Ti disc with SLA surface exhibited increased
      NPAS2 expression compared to BMSC cultured on a machined surface. A mouse model
      was developed in which miniature Ti implants were surgically placed into femur
      bone marrow. The implant push-out test and bone-to-implant contact measurements
      demonstrated the establishment of osseointegration in 3 weeks. By contrast, in
      Npas2 functional knockout (KO) mice, the implant push-out value measured for SLA 
      surface Ti implant was significantly decreased. Npas2 KO mice demonstrated normal
      femur bone structure surrounding the Ti implant; however, the recovered implants 
      revealed abnormal remnant mineralized tissue, which lacked dense collagen
      architecture typically found on recovered implants from wild type mice. To
      explore the mechanisms leading to the induced Npas2 expression, an unbiased
      chemical genetics analysis was conducted using mouse BMSC carrying an
      Npas2-reporter gene for high throughput screening of Library of Pharmacologically
      Active Compounds. Npas2 modulating compounds were found clustered in regulatory
      networks of the alpha2-adrenergic receptor and its downstream cAMP/CREB signaling
      pathway. Mouse primary BMSC exposed to SLA Ti disc significantly increased the
      expression of alpha2-adrenergic receptors, but the expression of beta2-adrenergic
      receptor was unaffected. Our data provides the first evidence that peripheral
      clock gene component Npas2 plays a role in facilitating the enhanced
      osseointegration through neuroskeletal regulatory pathways induced by BMSC in
      contact with rough surface Ti implant.

TI  - Explantation of an Osseointegrated Titanium Implant Using Laser-Induced
      Thermo-necrosis: A Case Report.
PG  - e151-e155
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6898 [doi]
AB  - Explantation of fully or partially osseointegrated titanium implants is a complex
      procedure for myriad reasons and often results in major bone loss and pronounced 
      defects of the hard and soft tissues. This may require more elaborate surgical
      interventions in cases of re-implantation. In this patient case, an
      osseointegrated titanium implant with some visible bone loss, missing attached
      mucosa at the buccal aspect, and a nonideal three-dimensional (3D) position had
      to be explanted. For this, the implant's inner connection was heated using a CO2 
      laser, which resulted in localized laser-induced thermo-necrosis at the
      bone-to-implant contact. One week following laser application, explantation could
      be performed easily with a torque slightly more than 35 Ncm. No complications
      occurred during the healing period. The result was a very easily performed
      explantation while preserving a maximum of the surrounding bony structure.
      Healing was uneventful, and no further visible bone loss could be observed during
      the healing time.

TI  - Do Penicillin-Allergic Patients Present a Higher Rate of Implant Failure?
PG  - 1390-1395
LID - 10.11607/jomi.7018 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this clinical study was to determinate if patients allergic
      to penicillin present a higher incidence of dental implant failure compared with 
      nonallergic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional clinical study 
      analyzed patients rehabilitated with endosseous dental implants between September
      2011 and July 2015, at the University Dental Clinic, School of Dentistry,
      International University of Catalonia (UIC). Prophylactic antibiotic therapy was 
      prescribed for all patients: a single dose of 2 g of amoxicillin taken orally 1
      hour before implant surgery for non-penicillin-allergic patients, and 600 mg of
      clindamycin taken orally 1 hour before the implant surgery for
      penicillin-allergic patients. Postsurgical antibiotics were prescribed to prevent
      early implant failures and postoperative infections: amoxicillin 750 mg three
      times a day for 7 days for nonallergic patients, and in patients with penicillin 
      allergy, 300 mg clindamycin every 6 hours for 7 days. Implant failure was defined
      as the removal of the implant for any reason and was classified as early or late 
      failure. RESULTS: A total of 1,210 patients' files were analyzed; 8.03% of
      nonallergic patients and 24.68% of penicillin-allergic patients presented at
      least one implant failure. In penicillin-allergic patients, 21.05% were
      classified as late implant failure and 78.95% as early implant failure, with a
      lack of osseointegration (80%) being the mean reason for an early implant
      failure. Penicillin-allergic patients demonstrated a higher risk of implant
      failure with a risk ratio of 3.84 (95% CI) compared with nonallergic patients.
      CONCLUSION: Penicillin-allergic patients treated with clindamycin presented
      almost four times the risk of suffering dental implant failure, although other
      variables such as implant brand, location, and the surgeon's skill might have
      influenced these results.

TI  - Psychometric Analysis and Masticatory Efficiency of Elderly People with
      Single-Implant Overdentures.
PG  - 1383-1389
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6557 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this paired clinical study was to evaluate psychometric
      parameters (patient satisfaction and masticatory ability) and masticatory
      efficiency in elderly people before and after oral rehabilitation by a
      single-implant overdenture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included elderly
      individuals with residual alveolar bone height classified as Class III or IV
      according to the American College of Prosthodontics, and who wore clinically
      unsatisfactory complete dentures. Subjects first received new maxillary and
      mandibular conventional complete dentures. After 2 months of patient adaptation
      to the new complete dentures, subjective and objective variables were measured.
      Satisfaction with the new complete dentures was verified by applying a visual
      analog scale to rate patient satisfaction with stability, comfort, ability to
      chew, ability to speak, ease of cleaning, esthetics, and general satisfaction of 
      their new complete dentures. Masticatory ability was assessed by asking
      participants to rate on a visual analog scale their ability to chew foods with
      different roughness and consistencies. Masticatory efficiency was measured by the
      sieving method using a silicone-based artificial test food. After evaluations
      were completed, each participant received one implant, which was placed in the
      symphysis region. After 3 months of implant osseointegration, the conventional
      complete dentures were transitioned to mandibular single-implant overdentures
      through placement of a low-profile attachment on the intaglio surface of the
      prostheses. Subjects used the single-implant overdentures for 2 months, and then 
      all variables were reevaluated. Parametric t test and nonparametric Wilcoxon
      statistical tests were used to analyze data. RESULTS: Participants reported
      increased satisfaction with stability of their mandibular single-implant
      overdentures compared with their new conventional complete dentures. However,
      satisfaction with the esthetics decreased when the new complete denture was
      converted into the single-implant overdenture (P < .05). Masticatory ability with
      the rehabilitation was not different between the new conventional complete
      dentures and the single-implant overdentures; however, transition to the
      single-implant overdenture greatly increased masticatory efficiency (P < .0001). 
      CONCLUSION: Single-implant overdentures changed the patient perceptions,
      improving their satisfaction with stability, although decreasing satisfaction
      with esthetics. Despite that, masticatory efficiency of elderly individuals with 
      decreased residual bone height was greatly improved after single-implant
      overdenture use.

      Treatment Concept: Finite Element Analysis Study.
PG  - 1287-1295
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6371 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this work was a finite element analysis of the effect of a
      sloped platform in tilted implants in the All-on-4 treatment concept on the level
      of maximum stresses in compact bone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Finite element
      modeling of the stresses at tilted microthread implants with standard and sloped 
      abutment platform under four loading conditions and two levels of
      osseointegration was performed. RESULTS: The sloped abutment platform in tilted
      implants positioned at rim bone level resulted in a two to four times reduction
      of the maximum von Mises stresses in the adjacent cortical bone compared with the
      standard platform. These stresses were well below the yield stress of the
      cortical bone. The main importance of the proposed sloped platform in tilted
      implants is substantial stress reduction in the case of immediate loading. The
      stress reduction also results in the reduction of the deformation of the
      framework of the All-on-4 concept. CONCLUSION: The suggested modification of the 
      slope of the abutment platform on tilted implants is recommended as a technically
      simple and highly effective solution for significant reduction of maximum
      stresses in the cortical bone around the implant.

TI  - Experience with bruxism in the everyday oral implantology practice in the
      Netherlands: a qualitative study.
PG  - 17040
LID - 10.1038/s41405-018-0006-4 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To explore how bruxism is dealt with by accredited oral
      implantologists within daily clinical practice. Materials and methods: Nine
      semi-structured interviews of oral implantologists practicing in non-academic
      clinical practices in the Netherlands were performed, and thematic analysis was
      conducted using a framework-based approach. Results: Oral implant treatments in
      bruxing patients were a generally well-accepted practice. Complications were
      often expected, with most being of minor impact. Contradictive attitudes emerged 
      on the topic of bruxism being an etiologic factor for peri-implant bone loss and 
      loss of osseointegration. Views on the ideal treatment plan varied, though the
      importance of the superstructure's occlusion and articulation features was
      repeatedly pointed at. Similarly, views on protective splints varied, regarding
      their necessity and material choice. Bruxism was diagnosed mainly by clinical
      examination, alongside with patient anamnesis and clinician's intuition. There
      was little attention for awake bruxism. Discussion: Bruxism was generally not
      considered a contraindication for implantological treatments by accredited oral
      implantologists. Views on the interaction between bruxism and bone loss/loss of
      osseointegration varied, as did views on the ideal treatment plan. Conclusions:
      There is a need for better understanding of the extent to which, and under which 
      circumstances, sleep and/or awake bruxism can be seen as causal factors for the
      occurrence of oral implant complications.

TI  - Loading icariin on titanium surfaces by phase-transited lysozyme priming and
      layer-by-layer self-assembly of hyaluronic acid/chitosan to improve surface
      osteogenesis ability.
PG  - 6751-6767
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S174953 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Icariin (ICA) is one of the main active constituents of Herba Epimedii
      for improving osteogenesis. It is necessary to create a simple and efficient
      method to load ICA onto the surface of titanium (Ti) implant. The purpose of this
      study was to establish a local ICA delivery system via a layer-by-layer (LbL)
      self-assembly system on phase-transited lysozyme (PTL)-primed Ti surface.
      Materials and methods: A PTL nanofilm was first firmly coated on the pristine Ti.
      Then, the ICA-loaded hyaluronic acid/chitosan (HA/CS) multilayer was applied via 
      the LbL system to form the HA/CS-ICA surface. This established HA/CS-ICA surface 
      was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron
      spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurement. The ICA release pattern of the 
      HA/CS-ICA surface was also examined. MC3T3-E1 osteoblast culture test and a rat
      model were used to evaluate the effects of the HA/CS-ICA surface in vitro and in 
      vivo. Results: SEM, XPS and contact angle measurement demonstrated successful
      fabrication of the HA/CS-ICA surface. The HA/CS-ICA surfaces with different ICA
      concentrations revealed a controlled release profile of ICA during a 2-week
      monitoring span. Osteoblasts grown on the coated substrates displayed higher
      adhesion, viability, proliferation and ALP activity than those on the polished Ti
      surface. Furthermore, in vivo histological evaluation revealed much obvious bone 
      formation in the ICA-coated group by histological staining and double fluorescent
      labeling at 2 weeks after implantation. Conclusion: The present study
      demonstrated that ICA-immobilized HA/CS multilayer on the PTL-primed Ti surface
      had a sustained release pattern of ICA which could promote the osteogenesis of
      osteoblasts in vitro and improve early osseointegration in vivo. This study
      provides a novel method for creating a sustained ICA delivery system to improve
      osteoblast response and osseointegration.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In recent years, zirconia dental implants have gained increased
      attention especially for patients with thin gingival biotypes or patients seeking
      metal-free restoration. While physical and chemical material surface properties
      govern the blood-material interaction and subsequent osseointegration processes, 
      the organizational principles underlying the interplay of biochemical and
      biophysical cues are still not well understood. Therefore, this study
      investigated how the interaction of a microstructured zirconia surface with blood
      influences its osseointegration potential compared to microstructured titanium
      with or without additional nanostructures. METHODS: Microstructured zirconia and 
      micro- (and nano)structured titanium surfaces were fabricated via sandblasting
      followed by acid etching and their topographical as well as physico-chemical
      features were thoroughly characterized. Following, an advanced in vitro approach 
      mimicking the initial blood interaction of material surfaces upon implantation
      was applied. Fibrinogen adsorption, human blood coagulation as well as their
      influence on cell fate decisions of primary human bone and progenitor cells (HBC)
      were studied. RESULTS: Obtained surface micro- and nanostructures on titanium
      surfaces were sharp with rugged peaks whereas zirconia surfaces were less rough
      with structures being shallower, more round and granular. Compared to titanium
      surfaces, the zirconia surface showed increased fibrinogen adsorption, higher
      levels of total accessible fibrinogen gamma-chain moieties yielding in increased 
      platelet adhesion and activation and consequently thrombogenicity. Mineralization
      of HBC on microstructured surfaces was significantly higher on zirconia than on
      titanium, but was significantly lower compared to titanium surfaces with
      nanostructures. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides insights into blood-material
      interaction and subsequent cellular events that are important for implant surface
      development.

TI  - Calcium phosphate coatings elaborated by the soaking process on titanium dental
      implants: Surface preparation, processing and physical-chemical characterization.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dental implant manufacturers are looking for new surfaces to improve
      osseointegration. It is accepted that calcium phosphate coatings favor bone
      healing. Among all the techniques, the soaking process seems attractive because
      of its ability in producing a bioactive coating at low temperature. The objective
      of this study is to improve the titanium implant surface roughness and chemistry 
      by optimizing the surface preparation and the soaking process parameters to
      produce a bioactive and adherent calcium phosphate coating. METHODS: Titanium
      samples were sandblasted and acid etched. Coatings were realized by an alternate 
      soaking process including a centrifugation step to create a phosphate solution
      thin film on the implant that reacts with the calcium of the second bath. We
      performed a characterization of the sample surface with complementary physical
      and physico-chemical techniques to assess the effect of surface preparation and
      coating process operating parameters on coating formation and characteristics.
      RESULTS: Surface preparation led to a roughness around 1.6mum, micro-porosities, 
      high surface wettability and removed the embedded sandblasting particles. We
      showed that the centrifugation step is critical and determines the coating
      formation, coverage and thickness. A thin coating ( approximately 2mum) composed 
      of apatite analogous to bone mineral was deposited. The coating adhesion was
      demonstrated by screwing/unscrewing test in an artificial jawbone. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      The titanium dental implant pre-treatment and coating developed in this study is 
      expected to favor early implant osseointegration through coating dissolution in
      vivo and could be associated with biological active agents to confer additional
      functionality to the coating.

TI  - Bioactive Sphene-Based Ceramic Coatings on cpTi Substrates for Dental Implants:
      An In Vitro Study.
LID - E2234 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ma11112234 [doi]
AB  - Titanium implant surface modifications have been widely investigated to favor the
      process of osseointegration. The present work aimed to evaluate the effect of
      sphene (CaTiSiO(5)) biocoating, on titanium substrates, on the in vitro
      osteogenic differentiation of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (hADSCs). Sphene
      bioceramic coatings were prepared using preceramic polymers and nano-sized active
      fillers and deposited by spray coating. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
      analysis, surface roughness measurements and X-ray diffraction analysis were
      performed. The chemical stability of the coatings in Tris-HCl solution was
      investigated. In vitro studies were performed by means of proliferation test of
      hADSCs seeded on coated and uncoated samples after 21 days. Methyl
      Thiazolyl-Tetrazolium (MTT) test and immunofluorescent staining with phalloidin
      confirmed the in vitro biocompatibility of both substrates. In vitro osteogenic
      differentiation of the cells was evaluated using Alizarin Red S staining and
      quantification assay and real-time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). When hADSCs
      were cultured in the presence of Osteogenic Differentiation Medium, a
      significantly higher accumulation of calcium deposits onto the sphene-coated
      surfaces than on uncoated controls was detected. Osteogenic differentiation on
      both samples was confirmed by PCR. The proposed coating seems to be promising for
      dental and orthopedic implants, in terms of composition and deposition
      technology.

AB  - Hydrothermal method is an easy-to-use approach for creating nanostructured
      surfaces on titanium (Ti). However, whether the alkali conditions of this method 
      influence the osteogenic potential of the modified surfaces remains unknown. In
      this study, we fabricated nanostructured surfaces, termed the Ti-1, Ti-5, and
      Ti-10 groups, by using the hydrothermal method in 1M, 5M, and 10M NaOH aqueous
      solutions, respectively. An untreated Ti surface served as a control. The
      osteogenic performance of modified surfaces was systemically investigated,
      including the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human
      osteoblast-like MG63 cells in vitro and the osteointegration of implants in a
      rabbit femoral condyle defect model. After hydrothermal treatment, the
      hydrophilicity of modified surfaces was greatly enhanced. The Ti-1 group showed a
      nanowire-like topography, while the Ti-5 and Ti-10 groups exhibited a
      nanopetal-like topography with different pore sizes. Compared with the untreated 
      Ti surface, the modified surfaces showed good cytocompatibility and enhanced the 
      osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 cells. Compared with the other modified
      surfaces, the Ti-5 group was the most favourable for the osteogenic
      differentiation of cells, showing higher levels of alkaline phosphatase activity,
      osteogenic gene expression, mineralization and osteoprotegerin secretion. Twelve 
      weeks after implantation at the bone defects, the Ti-5 group showed superior
      peri-implant bone regeneration and higher peak push-out force than the other
      groups. Overall, this study revealed the crucial role of alkali conditions of
      hydrothermal method in modulating the material characteristics of modified
      surfaces and their osteogenic performance in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the 
      need for optimizing the processing conditions of hydrothermal method for enhanced
      osteointegration.

TI  - Measurement of the "Bungee Dip" in Implant Stability Using Resonance Frequency
      Analysis: Two Case Reports.
PG  - 706-712
AB  - Implant stability is a key consideration when determining the point in time a
      dental implant should be loaded. Often a change in implant stability is observed 
      as healing progresses from initial mechanical stability to biologic stability,
      ie, osseointegration, during the bone modeling/remodeling process. This change in
      stability can be objectively measured using resonance frequency analysis (RFA).
      Because bone healing varies from patient to patient, the timing of this sequence 
      may be unpredictable; in a small subset of patients the drop in implant stability
      can be quite precipitous and profound. Such a drop is referred to as a "bungee
      dip." If the implant is loaded too prematurely, it may fail due to inadequate
      healing. This article presents two case reports that demonstrate the use of RFA
      and its values, known as implant stability quotients, to monitor implant
      stability during healing. RFA is a form of personalized care that provides
      objective evidence that can guide the clinician in establishing safe and
      successful loading protocols.

TI  - Auricular reconstruction with polyethylene implants or silicone prosthesis: A
      single institution experience.

AB  - Auricular reconstruction is usually necessary in patients with congenital
      malformations, after traumatic ear amputations or in cases of neoplastic ear
      disease. Thirty-nine patients who underwent an auricular reconstruction with
      either silicon prosthesis (21 patients) or porous polyethylene (18 patients)
      between 2002 and 2013 were retrospectively analyzed at a tertiary academic
      institution. A total of 25 male und 14 female patients were included in the
      study. In all, 43 implants were installed in 39 patients. An implant failure was 
      not observed in any of the examined groups. An operative revision was necessary
      in 5 patients in the silicon prosthesis group (N = 21) and in 4 patients in the
      porous polyethylene group (N = 18). The most common side effect in the porous
      polyethylene group was the formation of retroauricular adhesions in 11.1 % by
      postoperative scaring, while in the silicone prosthesis group 71.4 % of the
      patients presented with skin reactions around the titanium implants. Our study
      shows that both techniques are valuable and should be offered to patients in
      cases of auricular reconstruction due to the low rate of severe complications and
      the good functional results of both techniques.

TI  - Zirconium Nitride Coating Reduced Staphylococcus epidermidis Biofilm Formation on
      Orthopaedic Implant Surfaces: An In Vitro Study.
PG  - 461-466
LID - 10.1097/CORR.0000000000000568 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the most commonly identified pathogens responsible for
      orthopaedic implant infection is Staphylococcus epidermidis, which can form
      biofilms on surfaces. Currently, orthopaedic implants made of various surface
      materials are available, each with features influencing osseointegration,
      biocompatibility, and adherence of bacteria to the surface, which is the first
      step in biofilm formation. The aim of this experimental study was to investigate 
      the effect of a high tribologic-resistant 2.5-microm zirconium nitride top coat
      on an antiallergic multilayer ceramic-covered cobalt-chromium-molybdenum surface 
      on the formation of S. epidermidis biofilm compared with other commonly used
      smooth and rough orthopaedic implant surface materials. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1)
      When evaluating the surfaces of a cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (CoCrMo) alloy with 
      a zirconium (Zr) nitride coating, a CoCrMo alloy without a coating, titanium
      alloy, a titanium alloy with a corundum-blasted rough surface, and stainless
      steel with a corundum-blasted rough surface, does a Zr coating reduce the number 
      of colony-forming units of S. epidermidis in an in vitro setting? (2) Is there
      quantitatively less biofilm surface area on Zr-coated surfaces than on the other 
      surfaces tested in this in vitro model? METHODS: To determine bacterial adhesion,
      five different experimental implant surface discs were incubated separately with 
      one of 31 different S. epidermidis strains each and subsequently sonicated.
      Twenty test strains were obtained from orthopaedic patients undergoing emergency 
      hip prosthesis surgeries or revision of implant infection and 10 further strains 
      were obtained from the skin of healthy individuals. Additionally, one reference
      strain, S. epidermidis DSM 3269, was tested. After serial dilutions, the number
      of bacteria was counted and expressed as colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. For
      biofilm detection, discs were stained with 0.1% Safranin-O for 15 minutes,
      photographed, and analyzed with computer imaging software. RESULTS: The lowest
      bacterial count was found in the CoCrMo + Zr surface disc (6.6 x 10 CFU/mL +/-
      4.6 x 10 SD) followed by the CoCrMo surface (1.1 x 10 CFU/mL +/- 1.9 x 10 SD),
      the titanium surface (1.36 x 10 CFU/mL +/- 1.8 x 10 SD), the rough stainless
      steel surface (2.65 x 10 CFU/mL +/- 3.8 x 10 SD), and the rough titanium surface 
      (2.1 x 10 CFU/mL +/- 3.0 x 10 SD). The mean CFU count was lower for CoCrMo + Zr
      discs compared with the rough stainless steel surface (mean difference: 2.0 x 10,
      p = 0.021), the rough titanium alloy surface (mean difference: 1.4 x 10, p =
      0.002), and the smooth titanium surface (mean difference: 7.0 x 10, p = 0.016).
      The results of biofilm formation quantification show that the mean covered area
      of the surface of the CoCrMo + Zr discs was 19% (+/- 16 SD), which was lower than
      CoCrMo surfaces (35% +/- 23 SD), titanium alloy surface (46% +/- 20 SD), rough
      titanium alloy surface (66% +/- 23 SD), and rough stainless steel surface (58%
      +/- 18 SD). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that a multilayer,
      ceramic-covered, CoCrMo surface with a 2.5-microm zirconium nitride top coat
      showed less S. epidermidis biofilm formation compared with other surface
      materials used for orthopaedic implants. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: CoCrMo with a
      2.5-microm zirconium nitride top coat seems to be a promising surface
      modification technology able to reduce bacterial attachment on the surface of an 
      implant and, hence, may further prevent implant infection with S. epidermidis
      biofilm formation.

TI  - Resveratrol reverses the negative effect of smoking on peri-implant repair in the
      tibia of rats.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1111/clr.13384 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Innovative approaches capable to improve peri-implant bone repair are
      relevant in the presence of smoking, a risk factor for healing around implants.
      This study investigated the effect of resveratrol (RESV) on peri-implant repair, 
      and its influence on bone-related markers in rats submitted to cigarette smoking 
      inhalation (CSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: One titanium implant was inserted in
      each tibiae of rats assigned to CSI+RESV (n:18); CSI+placebo (n:18); and non-CSI 
      (n:18). One implant was removed for counter torque, and the peri-implant tissue
      was collected for mRNA quantification of BMP-2, OPN, Runx2, Lrp-5, Osx,
      beta-catenin, Dkk1, OPG, and RANKL. The other tibia was submitted to microCT to
      measure: bone volume, bone porosity, trabecular spacing, trabecular thickness,
      and bone-implant contact (BIC). RESULTS: No differences were detected between
      counter torque in CSI+RESV and non-CSI group (p > 0.05), whereas CSI+placebo
      group presented lower values when compared to the others (p < 0.05). RESV
      improved the BIC in CSI rats without differences when compared to non-CSI group
      (p > 0.05), whereas CSI+placebo showed reduced BIC when compared to the other
      groups (p < 0.05). RESV reduced RANKL/OPG and Lrp-5 levels and increased
      beta-catenin in CSI rats when compared to CSI+placebo (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION:
      Although further investigations should be considered using oral models of dental 
      implants, within the limits of the present study, it was concluded that RESV
      reverses the negative effects of smoking in the peri-implant repair, benefiting
      the modulation of bone-related markers.

TI  - Retrospective analysis of porous tantalum trabecular metal-enhanced titanium
      dental implants.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The design of porous tantalum trabecular metal-enhanced
      titanium (TM) dental implants promises improved osseointegration, especially when
      grafting materials such as demineralized bone matrix are used; however, studies
      are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare TM
      implants with conventional titanium alloy (Ti) implants with and without
      demineralized bone matrix in terms of peri-implant bone remodeling in the first
      year after implant loading. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A chart review was used for all
      patients receiving Tapered Screw-Vent Ti and TM implants. Implants were placed
      and restored by a single provider between 2011 and 2015. Peri-implant bone
      remodeling was compared by using a paired t test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: A total of
      82 patients received 205 implants, 44 TM and 161 Ti implants (control). No
      implants failed in the TM group (survival rate of 100%), and 3 implants in total,
      1 immediate, failed in the Ti groups (survival rate of 98.1%). TM implants
      exhibited a 0.28-mm bone gain on average, whereas the control group demonstrated 
      0.20 mm of marginal bone loss after the first year of implant loading.
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the odds of having
      bone loss was 64% less (odds ratio: 0.36; 95% confidence interval: 0.14-0.94) in 
      the TM group than in the Ti group after controlling for bone grafting, implant
      location, immediate placement, bone type, and pretreatment bone level.
      CONCLUSIONS: TM implants exhibited less peri-implant bone loss than the control
      Ti implants.

AB  - Bacteria initiated peri-implantitis can lead to bone destruction around a dental 
      implant, modifying its surface and preventing re-osseointegration. Consequently, 
      all available methods for treating periimplantitis have disappointing long-term
      results. Implant failure will lead to loss of the prosthetic reconstruction as
      well. A fresh new implant surface enables re-osseointegration. Our hypothesis is 
      that a fresh new surface replacing a contaminated implant surface may be a new
      treatment approach for peri-implantitis and may allow re-osseointegration. A new 
      two-piece dental implant, having a replaceable thin titanium sleeve may be
      designed. The replacement of a contaminated sleeve by a fresh new sleeve will
      solve the peri-implant disease by removing the contaminated surface, enabling
      re-osseointegration and ensuring long-term stability of the implant without
      endangering the prosthetic reconstruction. This minimally-invasive therapy is
      expected to be conducted in a simple manner, by every practicing dentist, during 
      supportive periodontal treatment, thereby facilitating the treatment of
      peri-implantitis.

TI  - RGD-modified dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase as a molecular bridge for enhancing
      the adhesion of bone forming cells to titanium dioxide implant surfaces.
PG  - 545-551
LID - 10.1002/jbm.a.36570 [doi]
AB  - Titanium and its alloys are widely used in dental- and orthopedic implants, the
      outer surface of which is often oxidized to titanium dioxide (TiO2 ). To achieve 
      efficient osseointegration with bone-forming cells, it is desirable to counter
      the formation of the soft fibrous tissue around the implant by creating strong
      and stable interactions between the implant surface and bone-forming osteoblasts.
      To address this challenge, a bioactive coating had to be designed. Protein
      adsorption to TiO2 is well known in the literature, but it is mostly
      characterized by weak associations, rendering less efficient implant
      osseointegration. We have previously demonstrated the unique conjugation between 
      the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLDH) protein and TiO2 surfaces, based on
      specific coordinative bonding via Cys-His-Glu-Asp motif residues. To enhance cell
      binding to DLDH and facilitate osseointegration, DLDH was bioengineered to
      include Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) moieties (DLDH(RGD) ). Coating TiO2 disks with
      DLDH(RGD) led to improved adherence of integrin-expressing osteogenic MBA-15 to
      the surface of the disks. Following the enhanced adsorption, higher proliferation
      rates of the adherent cells, as well as faster mineralization were observed,
      compared to controls. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A:

TI  - MicroRNA-29a-3p enhances dental implant osseointegration of hyperlipidemic rats
      via suppressing dishevelled 2 and frizzled 4.
PG  - 55
LID - 10.1186/s13578-018-0254-y [doi]
AB  - Background: Fine osseointegration is the basis of long-term survival of implant. 
      In our previous study, we observed a strong correlation between hyperlipidemia
      and compromised osseointegration. MicroRNA-29a-3p (miR-29a-3p) has been
      discovered to participate in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)
      differentiation. However, the role and the underlying mechanisms of
      hyperlipidemia and miR-29a-3p in osseointegration still remain obscure. Results: 
      In peri-implant bone tissues of hyperlipidemia rats, bone mass, mineralization
      and bone trabecula formation were weakened. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and
      runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and miR-29a-3p expression were
      reduced. While in normal rats, implant-bone interfaces were filled with dense new
      bone and ALP, Runx2 and miR-29a-3p were up-regulated. Overexpressed miR-29a-3p
      can reverse the adverse effect of hyperlipidemia on osseointegration. Implants
      were tightly integrated with the surrounding dense new bone tissues, and ALP as
      well as Runx2 mRNAs were enhanced in miR-29a-3p overexpressed and hyperlipidemia 
      rats, while little peri-implant bone tissue existed, ALP and Runx2 deregulated on
      miR-29a-3p inhibited rats. Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2) mRNA was declined in peri-implant
      bone tissue of high-fat (HF) group than normal group, while frizzled 4 (Fzd4)
      mRNA declined on day 5 and increased from day 10 to day 20 after implantation in 
      hyperlipidemia rats than in normal rats. Next, BMSCs were cultured under HF or
      normal medium in vitro. In the HF group, ALP activity and mineralization, ALP and
      Runx2 mRNAs and proteins expression, and miR-29a-3p expression were suppressed,
      while adipogenesis was increased, as a result, cytoskeletons were sparse and
      disordered compared to control group. However, when miR-29a-3p was overexpressed 
      in BMSCs, ALP activity, ALP, Runx2, Dvl2 and Fzd4 mRNAs and proteins expressions 
      were up-regulated. As miR-29a-3p was inhibited in BMSCs, the reverse results were
      obtained. In addition, promoter assay revealed that miR-29a-3p can directly
      suppress Wnt/beta-catenin pathway related Dvl2 and Fzd4 through binding to their 
      3'-UTR. Conclusions: MiR-29a-3p facilitated implant osseointegration via
      targeting Wnt/beta-catenin pathway-related Dvl2 and Fzd4. MiR-29a-3p/Dvl2/Fzd4
      may serve as a promising therapeutic target for hyperlipidemia osseointegration.

TI  - Bone regeneration around immediate placed implant of molar teeth with autologous 
      platelet-rich fibrin: Two case reports.
PG  - e13058
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000013058 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: There are some challenges concerning immediate implant placement in
      molar region. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), a second generation platelet
      concentrate, is an autologous fibrin matrix and contains platelets, growth
      factors, and leukocytes. It is used for tissue healing and regeneration in
      periodontal and oral-maxillofacial surgery. We report 2 cases of immediate placed
      implant of molar teeth with autologous PRF to improve and accelerate tissue
      healing. PATIENT CONCERNS: Case 1 was a 38-year-old female patient with
      masticatory discomfort. Case 2 was a 43-year-old male patient with a demand for
      his left mandibular posterior tooth restoration. DIAGNOSES: Through the clinical 
      and radiographic examination, the patient in case 1 was diagnosed with vertical
      root crown fracture of the maxillary right first molar. The patient in case 2 was
      diagnosed with residual root of the left mandibular first molar via cone-beam
      computer tomography and clinical examination. INTERVENTIONS: The 2 patients
      underwent extraction of the molar teeth and immediate placed implant of molar
      teeth with autologous PRF was performed. In case 1, the gap between the implant
      surface and the socket walls of freshly extracted tooth was filled with PRF mixed
      with a commercial spongious bone substitute, followed by 2 PRF membranes coverage
      for protection. In case 2, PRF was used as a sole bone substitute material,
      placed between immediate implant and the socket wall of freshly extracted tooth. 
      OUTCOMES: Follow-up of 2 cases revealed successful osseointegration and matured
      gingiva with optimal form and function. LESSONS: The results suggested that PRF
      could solely serve as a bone scaffold in 4-wall bony defects, or can be combined 
      with xenograft in 3-wall bony defects during immediately placed implants in molar
      regions, exhibiting excellent biocompatibility and good soft and hard tissue
      healing.

TI  - A prospective clinical study to evaluate the performance of zirconium dioxide
      dental implants in single-tooth edentulous area: 3-year follow-up.
PG  - 181
LID - 10.1186/s12903-018-0636-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditionally, dental implants have been made from titanium or
      titanium alloys. Alternatively, zirconia-based ceramic implants have been
      developed with similar characteristics of functional strength and
      osseointegration. Ceramic implants offer advantages in certain settings, e.g. in 
      patients who object to metal dental implants. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the mid-term (36 months) clinical performance of a ceramic monotype
      implant in single-tooth edentulous area. METHODS: This was a prospective,
      open-label, single-arm study in patients requiring implant rehabilitation in
      single-tooth edentulous area. Ceramic implants (PURE Ceramic Implant, Institut
      Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland) with a diameter of 4.1 mm were placed following
      standard procedure and loaded with provisional and final prostheses after 3 and 6
      months, respectively. Implant survival rate and implant success rate were
      evaluated and crestal bone levels were measured by analysing standardized
      radiographs during implant surgery and at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. RESULTS:
      Forty-four patients received a study implant, of whom one patient withdrew
      consent after 3 months. With one implant lost during the first 6 months after
      surgery, the implant survival rate was 97.7% at 6 months. No further implants
      were lost over the following 30 months, and 3 patients were lost to follow-up
      during this time frame. This led to a survival rate of 97.5% at 36 months. Six
      months after implant surgery 93.0% of the implants were considered "successful", 
      increasing to 97.6% at 12 months and remaining at this level at 24 months (95.1%)
      and 36 months (97.5%). Bone loss was most pronounced in the first half-year after
      implant surgery (0.88 +/- 0.86 mm). By contrast, between 12 and 36 months the
      mean bone level remained stable (minimal gain of 0.06 [+/- 0.60] mm). Hence, the 
      overall bone loss from implant surgery to 36 months was 0.97 (+/- 0.88) mm.
      CONCLUSIONS: In the follow-up period ceramic implants can achieve favourable
      clinical outcomes on a par with titanium implants. For instance, these implants
      can be recommended for patients who object to metal dental implants. However,
      longer term studies with different edentulous morphology need to confirm the
      present data. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov :

AB  - This randomized clinical trial evaluated the insertion torque (IT), primary, and 
      secondary stability of dental implants with different surface treatments during
      the osseointegration period. Nineteen patients with bilateral partial edentulism 
      in the posterior mandibular region were randomly allocated to two implant brand
      groups and received implants with different surface treatments in the opposite
      site of the arch: Osseotite and Nanotite or SLA and SLActive. During implant
      placement, the maximum IT was recorded using a surgical motor equipped with a
      graphical user interface. The implant stability quotient (ISQ) was assessed
      immediately after the IT, and was measured weekly via resonance frequency
      analysis during 3 months. The data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA, the
      Bonferroni test, paired t tests and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The IT
      values were similar (p > 0.05) for all implant types ranging from 43.82 +/- 6.50 
      to 46.84 +/- 5.06. All implant types behaved similarly until the 28th day (p >
      0.05). Between 35 and 56 days, Osseotite and SLActive showed lower ISQ values (p 
      < 0.001) compared to Nanotite and SLA implants. After 56 days, only Osseotite
      maintained significantly lower ISQ values than the other implants (p < 0.05).
      After 91 days the ISQ values were significantly higher than the baseline for all 
      four implant types (p < 0.001). The ISQ and IT values were significantly
      correlated at the baseline and at the final evaluation for Osseotite, Nanotite,
      and SLActive implants (p < 0.001). After 91 days, ISQ and IT values were only
      significantly correlated for the Osseotite implants (p < 0.05). All implants
      types exhibited acceptable primary and secondary stability.

TI  - Evaluation of the milling technique on the component-bone interface in the TATE
      elbow.
PG  - 50-56
LID - 10.1111/vsu.13115 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the surgeon can influence the accuracy of milling
      during the TATE elbow arthroplasty by applying force to the milling arm during
      the milling procedure. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro study on Sawbone specimens. SAMPLE 
      POPULATION: Thirty identical solid foam models of the canine right humerus, elbow
      joint, and antebrachium (size large). METHODS: TATE elbow arthroplasty was
      performed on 30 elbows equally divided into 3 types of forces applied to the
      milling arm: (1) no force, (2) a maximally converging force, and (3) a maximally 
      diverging force using the center of rotation post as a reference point. The
      resulting component-bone interface and post fit were quantified with digital
      photography. RESULTS: The component-bone interface gap differed between
      techniques for most angles. The application of convergent or divergent milling
      forces frequently increased the component-bone interface gap. Post fit was also
      influenced by the milling technique, application of a convergent or divergent
      milling force affecting the fit of multiple posts. Interface gaps tended to be
      greater on the lateral aspect, an area that is not visible to the surgeon
      intraoperatively. CONCLUSION: In this bone model study, application of convergent
      or divergent forces during milling frequently resulted in greater component-bone 
      interface gaps and poorer post fit than when a neutral position was maintained.
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Surgeons may affect implant fit within the constraints of 
      the current arthroplasty system if they do not maintain a neutral position during
      milling. Greater component-bone interface gaps and poorer post fit may affect
      component osseointegration and lead to aseptic implant loosening.

TI  - Development of a quantitative preclinical screening model for implant
      osseointegration in rat tail vertebra.
LID - 10.1007/s00784-018-2661-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Functional tooth replacement and bone regeneration are parts of the
      daily practice in modern dentistry, but well-reproducible and relatively
      inexpensive experimental models are still missing. We aimed to develop a new
      small animal model to monitor osseointegration utilizing the combination of
      multiple evaluation protocols. MATERIAL AND METHODS: After cutting the tail
      between the C4 and C5 vertebrae in Wistar rats, costume made, parallel walled,
      non-threaded implants were placed into the center of the tail parallel with its
      longitudinal axis using a surgical guide. Osseointegration of the titanium
      implants was followed between 4 and 16 weeks after surgery applying axial
      extraction force, and resonance frequency analysis as functional tests, and
      histomorphometry and micro-CT as structural evaluations. RESULTS: In functional
      tests, we observed that both methods are suitable for the detection of the
      time-dependent increase in osseointegration, but the sensitivity of the pull-out 
      technique (an approximately five times increase with rather low standard error)
      was much higher than that of the resonance frequency analysis. In structural
      evaluations, changes in the detected bone implant contact values measured by
      histomorphometry (yielding 1.5 times increase, with low variations of data) were 
      more reliable than micro-CT based evaluations to screen the developments of
      contact between bone and implant. CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that
      the caudal vertebrae osseointegration model is useful for the preclinical
      evaluation of implant integration into the bone. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The
      combination of the biomechanical and structural tests offers a well-reproducible 
      small animal system that can be suitable for studying the integration of various 
      implant materials and surface treatments.

TI  - Role of the Complement System in the Response to Orthopedic Biomaterials.
LID - E3367 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms19113367 [doi]
AB  - Various synthetic biomaterials are used to replace lost or damaged bone tissue
      that, more or less successfully, osseointegrate into the bone environment. Almost
      all biomaterials used in orthopedic medicine activate the host-immune system to a
      certain degree. The complement system, which is a crucial arm of innate immunity,
      is rapidly activated by an implanted foreign material into the human body, and it
      is intensely studied regarding blood-contacting medical devices. In contrast,
      much less is known regarding the role of the complement system in response to
      implanted bone biomaterials. However, given the increasing knowledge of the
      complement regulation of bone homeostasis, regeneration, and inflammation,
      complement involvement in the immune response following biomaterial implantation 
      into bone appears very likely. Moreover, bone cells can produce complement
      factors and are target cells of activated complement. Therefore, new bone
      formation or bone resorption around the implant area might be greatly influenced 
      by the complement system. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on 
      biomaterial-mediated complement activation, with a focus on materials primarily
      used in orthopedic medicine. In addition, methods to modify the interactions
      between the complement system and bone biomaterials are discussed, which might
      favor osseointegration and improve the functionality of the device.

TI  - Determining the porous structure for optimal soft-tissue ingrowth: An in vivo
      histological study.
PG  - e0206228
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0206228 [doi]
AB  - The success of osseointegrated transcutaneous prostheses depends on a soft-tissue
      seal forming at the skin-implant interface in order to prevent infection. Current
      designs include a flange with drilled holes or a subdermal barrier with a porous 
      coating in an attempt to promote soft-tissue attachment. However, the soft-tissue
      seal is not reliably achieved despite these designs and infection remains a
      significant problem. This study investigated soft-tissue integration into fully
      porous titanium alloy structures with interconnected pores. The study aimed to
      determine the effect of altering pore and strut size combinations on soft-tissue 
      ingrowth into porous titanium alloy structures in vivo. It was hypothesized that 
      implants with a more open porous structure with larger pore sizes would increase 
      soft-tissue ingrowth more than less open porous structures. Porous titanium alloy
      cylinders were inserted into sheep paparaspinal muscles (n = 6) and left in situ 
      for four weeks. A histological assessment of soft-tissue ingrowth was performed. 
      Percentage soft-tissue pore fill, cell nuclei density and blood vessel density
      were quantified. The results showed that larger pore sizes were supportive of
      soft-tissue ingrowth. A structure with a pore size of 700mum and a strut size of 
      300mum supported revascularisation to the greatest degree. A flange with this
      structure may be used in future studies of osseointegrated transcutaneous
      prostheses in order to enhance the soft-tissue seal.

TI  - Quercitrin Nanocoated Implant Surfaces Reduce Osteoclast Activity In Vitro and In
      Vivo.
LID - E3319 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms19113319 [doi]
AB  - In this study, the effect on osteoclast activity in vitro and in vivo of titanium
      implants that were coated with quercitrin was evaluated. Titanium surfaces were
      covalently coated with the flavonoid quercitrin. The effect of the surfaces on
      osteoclastogenesis was first tested in vitro on RAW264.7 cells that were
      supplemented with receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) to 
      generate osteoclast-like cells by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)
      inmunostaining after five days of culture, and by analysis of the mRNA expression
      levels of markers related to bone resorption after seven days of culture. A
      rabbit tibial model was used to evaluate the in vivo biological response to the
      implant surfaces after eight weeks of healing, analyzing the lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH) and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities in the wound
      fluid that were present at the implant interface and the peri-implant bone mRNA
      expression levels of several markers related to inflammation, bone resorption and
      osteoblast-osteoclast interaction. No differences between groups and control
      surfaces were found in the wound fluid analyses. Moreover, quercitrin implant
      surfaces significantly decreased the expression of osteoclast related genes in
      vitro (Trap, CalcR, Ctsk, H(+)ATPase, Mmp9) and in vivo (Ctsk, H(+)ATPase, Mmp9) 
      as well as the expression of RankL in vivo. Moreover, quercitrin surfaces were
      not cytotoxic for the cells. Thus, quercitrin implant surfaces were biocompatible
      and decreased osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo. This could be used to
      improve the performance of dental implants.

AB  - Data sourcesThe databases searched were the Cochrane Library, PubMed/Medline,
      Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus and SIGLE OpenGrey. Databases were searched 
      with no restriction on year of publication or language.Study selectionRandomised 
      controlled clinical trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective studies,
      case-control studies and case series studies in humans were included. The test
      group received implants with the local delivery of bisphosphonates, controls
      received implants only. Studies involving patients with metabolic bone diseases
      or undergoing systemic medications for bone bio-modulation or immunosuppression
      or with relevant pathologies were excluded.Data extraction and synthesisThree
      authors independently selected studies with disagreements being resolved by
      discussion. Study quality was assessed by two reviewers using the
      Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS).ResultsThree articles published between 2010 and
      2013 met the selection criteria. Sample size ranged from five to 39. Mean age was
      52.6 to 66. Efficacy was assessed using radiographic analysis, implant stability 
      quotient (ISQ) and histological assessment. Despite methodological differences,
      all articles reported positive results for osseointegration when a local
      bisphosphonate was used, either on the implant surface or direct application of a
      pharmacologically active compound at the surgical site or in the form of a gel
      directly at the surgical site. Greater implant stability, better implant survival
      rates and reduced peri-implant bone loss were recorded in the test groups
      compared with controls. As well as formation of lamellar bone trabeculae in
      intimate contact with the implants.ConclusionsThe local use of a bisphosphonate
      appears to favour the osseointegration of titanium implants in humans.

TI  - Clinical Management Protocol for Dental Implants Inserted in Patients with Active
      Lichen Planus. Part II 4-Year Follow-Up.
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12993 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate marginal bone loss (MBL) of dental implants inserted in
      active lichen planus patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 59
      subjects divided into 3 groups depending on their lichen planus diagnosis and
      administration of a low dose of corticosteroids: 17 healthy individuals, 20
      controlled lichen planus patients controlled using low doses of systemic
      corticosteroids, and 22 noncontrolled lichen planus patients. During 4-year
      follow-up sessions MBL was evaluated, and biopsies were collected from lichen
      planus patients and examined. Two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the data (alpha =
      0.05). RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in MBL between 
      healthy and controlled patients; however, noncontrolled patients exhibited
      increased MBL (F = 1309, p < 0.001) which reached 2.53 mm after 4 years. There
      were significant interactions between state of the disease (F = 1309, p < 0.001),
      evaluation time (F = 317, p < 0.001), and interaction between state of the
      disease and observation time (F = 159, p < 0.001). Histopathologic examination of
      collected biopsies revealed healthy tissue architecture of the controlled
      patients, while inflammatory cellular infiltration and signs of classical
      destructive tissue were observed for noncontrolled patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lichen 
      planus patients receiving dental implants should be controlled on a low-dose of
      corticosteroids to prevent accelerated MBL and to reduce remission of clinical
      manifestations.

      implantation failure. 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25VD3) plays a vital role 
      in osteogenesis, whereas its effects on the osseointegration and the underlying
      mechanism are unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate that 1,25VD3 
      might promote the defensive ability of osseointegration through suppressing
      AGEs/RAGE in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In animal study, streptozotocin-induced
      diabetic rats accepted implant surgery, with or without 1,25VD3 intervention for 
      12 weeks. After sacrificed, the serum AGEs level, bone microarchitecture and
      biomechanical index of rats were measured systematically. In vitro study,
      osteoblasts differentiation capacity was analyzed by alizarin red staining,
      alkaline phosphatase assay and western blotting, after treated with BSA, AGEs,
      AGEs with RAGE inhibitor and AGEs with 1,25VD3. And the expression of RAGE
      protein was detected to explore the mechanism. Results showed that 1,25VD3 could 
      reverse the impaired osseointegration and mechanical strength, which possibly
      resulted from the increased AGEs. Moreover, 1,25VD3 could ameliorate AGEs-induced
      damage of cell osteogenic differentiation, as well as downregulating the RAGE
      expression. These data may provide a theoretical basis that 1,25VD3 could work as
      an adjuvant treatment to against poor osseointegration in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Biological activity of the implant for internal fixation.
PG  - 2248-2255

AB  - Early treatment of bone fractures was performed using implants, which are often
      used in the form of plates of various types, which are fixed on the bone surface 
      (extracellular fixation) and nails that are located in the medullary canal
      (intracerebral fixation). The goal of this study was to investigate the features 
      of osseointegration of implants for internal fixation (intramedullary or
      extramedullary) with various bioactive coating techniques. During experimental
      study on 20 mongrel dogs, the implant model in the form of 1.0-mm plate made of
      titanium alloy (Ti6Al 4V) was placed in the medullary canal (first series) or
      under the periosteum (second series): the plates had bioactive coating
      (hydroxyapatite) produced using the technology of magnetron sputtering (six
      animals), plasma electrolytic oxidation or microarc oxidation technology (PEO;
      eight animals), and composite technology (six dogs). Anatomic and histological
      studies have shown that the process of active osseointegration of porous implants
      with bioactive coating begins after 7 days: at first, granulation tissue - and
      then fibrous connective tissue - is formed; after 14 days, the osteogenic
      substrate can be found, and after 28 days, the entire implant area is covered by 
      the lamellar bone tissue, which creates single implant-bone block. The most
      active formation of bone tissue is observed around implants with bioactive
      coating produced using the last two technologies. Low traumatic placement of
      porous implants with bioactive coating in the medullary canal or subperiosteally 
      provides the stimulation of reparative osteogenesis and rapid (especially with
      PEO technique) osseointegration of the implant.

TI  - Antibacterial and Bioactive Surface Modifications of Titanium Implants by
      PCL/TiO(2) Nanocomposite Coatings.
LID - E860 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano8100860 [doi]
AB  - Surface modification of biomedical implants is an established strategy to improve
      tissue regeneration, osseointegration and also to minimize the bacterial
      accumulation. In the present study, electrospun
      poly(epsilon-caprolactone)/titania (PCL/TiO(2)) nanocomposite coatings were
      developed on commercially pure titanium (cpTi) substrates for an improved
      biological and antibacterial properties for bone tissue engineering. TiO(2)
      nanoparticles in various amounts (2, 5, and 7 wt %) were incorporated into a
      biodegradable PCL matrix to form a homogeneous solution. Further, PCL/TiO(2)
      coatings on cpTi were obtained by electrospinning of PCL/TiO(2) solution onto the
      substrate. The resulted coatings were structurally characterized and inspected by
      employing scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and
      Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Given the potential biological
      applications of PCL/TiO(2) coated cpTi substrates, the apatite-forming capacity
      was examined by immersing in simulated body fluid (SBF) for upto 21 days.
      Biocompatibility has been evaluated through adhesion/proliferation of hFOB
      osteoblast cell lines and cytotoxicity by MTT assay. Antimicrobial activity of
      PCL/TiO(2) nanocomposites has been tested using UV light against gram-positive
      Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus). The resulting surface displays good bioactive
      properties against osteoblast cell lines with increased viability of 40% at day 3
      and superior antibacterial property against S.aureus with a significant reduction
      of bacteria to almost 76%. Surface modification by PCL/TiO(2) nanocomposites
      makes a viable approach for improving dual properties, i.e., biological and
      antibacterial properties on titanium implants which might be used to prevent
      implant-associated infections and promoting cell attachment of orthopedic devices
      at the same time.

AB  - Metallic implant materials are biomaterials that have experienced major
      development over the last fifty years, yet some demands posed to them have not
      been addressed. For the osseointegration process and the outcome of endosseous
      implantation, it is crucial to reduce the stress shielding effect and achieve
      sufficient biocompatibility. Powder metallurgy (PM) was utilized in this study to
      fabricate a new type of titanium (Ti) + magnesium (Mg) bioactive composite to
      enable stress-shielding reduction and obtain better biocompatibility compared
      with that of the traditional Ti and Ti alloys used for dental implants. Such
      composites are produced by well-known cost-effective and widely used PM methods, 
      which eliminate the need for complex and costly Ti casting used in traditional
      implant production. The relation between the microstructure and mechanical
      properties of as-extruded Ti + (0-24) vol% Mg composites was investigated with
      respect to the Mg content. The microstructure of the composites consisted of a
      biodegradable Mg component in the form of filaments, elongated along the
      direction of extrusion, which were embedded within a permanent, bioinert Ti
      matrix. As the Mg content was increased, the discrete filaments became
      interconnected with each other and formed a continuous Mg network. Young's
      modulus (E) of the composites was reduced to 81GPa, while other tensile
      mechanical properties were maintained at the values required for a dental implant
      material. The corrosion behavior of the Ti + Mg composites was studied during
      immersion in a Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) for up to 21 days. The
      elution of Mg pores formed at former Mg sites led to a further decrease of E to
      74GPa. The studied compositions showed that a new Ti + Mg metallic composite
      should be promising for load-bearing applications in endosseous dental implants
      in the future.

AB  - Dental implants need to support good osseointegration into the surrounding bone
      for full functionality. Interconnected porous structures have a lower stiffness
      and larger surface area compared with bulk structures, and therefore are likely
      to enable better bone-implant fixation. In addition, grading of the porosity may 
      enable large pores for ingrowth on the periphery of an implant and a denser core 
      to maintain mechanical properties. However, given the small diameter of dental
      implants it is very challenging to achieve gradations in porosity. This paper
      investigates the use of Selective Laser Melting (SLM) to produce a range of
      titanium structures with regular and graded porosity using various CAD models.
      This includes a novel 'Spider Web' design and lattices built on a diamond unit
      cell. Well-formed interconnecting porous structures were successfully developed
      in a one-step process. Mechanical testing indicated that the compression
      stiffness of the samples was within the range for cancellous bone tissue.
      Characterization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray micro-computed
      tomography (muCT) indicated the designed porosities were well-replicated. The
      structures supported bone cell growth and deposition of bone extracellular
      matrix.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The reconstruction of complex cranial defects is challenging and is
      associated with a high complication rate. The development of a patient-specific, 
      titanium-reinforced, calcium phosphate-based (CaP-Ti) implant with bone
      regenerative properties has previously been described in 2 case studies with the 
      hypothesis that the implant may improve clinical outcome. OBJECTIVE: To identify 
      whether the introduction of CaP-Ti implant has the potential to improve clinical 
      outcome. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients having undergone CaP-Ti 
      cranioplasty was conducted. Comprehensive clinical data were collected from the
      hospital computer database and patient records. Bone formation and
      osseointegration were analyzed in a single retrieval specimen. RESULTS: Fifty
      patients, with 52 cranial defects, met the inclusion criteria. The patient cohort
      displayed a previous failure rate of 64% (32/50) with autologous bone,
      alloplastic materials, or both. At a median follow-up time of 25 months, the
      explantation rate due to either early postoperative infection or persistent wound
      dehiscence was 1.9% (1/53) or 3.8% (2/53), respectively. Surgical intervention
      with local wound revision was required in 2 patients without the need of implant 
      removal. One patient had a brain tumor recurrence, and the implant was explanted 
      31 months after implantation. Histologic examination showed that the entire
      implant was partly yet evenly transformed into vascularized compact bone.
      CONCLUSION: In the present study the CaP-Ti implant appears to have improved the 
      clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients with a high rate of previous
      cranioplasty failures. The bone regenerative effect may in particular have an
      impact on the long-term success rate of the implant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study shows the relationship between host factors and
      environmental factors in the influence of susceptibility to loss of dental
      implants. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of
      clinical aspects and tag SNPs of the genes LTA, TNFA, and LTB with dental implant
      loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects consisted of 244 patients, divided into
      two groups: control group (C)-163 individuals who did not lose any implants,
      being in function for at least 6 months; and study group (S)-81 individuals who
      had lost at least one implant. DNA was collected from saliva, and the genotypes
      were determined by real time PCR. Univariate and multivariate analysis were
      employed p < .05. RESULTS: After multivariate analysis, dental implant loss
      remained associated with the presence of teeth (p = .011), a larger amount of
      placed implants (p = .001), and allelle C of rs2009658 of the LTA gene (p =
      .006). For the other tag SNPs of these studied genes, there was no association
      between the groups C and S with dental implants loss. CONCLUSION: Presence of
      teeth, number of placed implants and allele C of rs2009658 of LTA gene were
      associated with implant loss.

LID - 10.1039/c8bm00901e [doi]
AB  - Fast degradation of Mg-based implants results in the loss of mechanical integrity
      and poor osseointegration. Herein, a bilayer-structured coating (termed as HAT), 
      comprising an outer layer of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanorods and an inner layer of
      pores-sealed MgO with HA/Mg(OH)2, was formed on Mg using plasma electrolytic
      oxidation and hydrothermal treatment. Osteoimmunomodulation, osseointegration,
      mechanical integrity, and bone-implant interfacial structure evolution of the
      HAT-coated Mg were investigated by implantation in rabbit femora, together with
      Mg coated with plasma electrolytic oxidized porous MgO (termed as PEO0) and bare 
      Mg. As compared to PEO0-coated and bare Mg, HAT-coated Mg greatly downregulated
      pro-inflammatory TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, upregulated anti-inflammatory IL-10, and
      suppressed osteoclastogenesis, modulating the surrounding microenvironment toward
      favoring the recruitment of osteogenetic cells. Moreover, HAT-coated Mg
      accelerated bone sialoprotein and osteopontin secretion of osteogenetic cells and
      their mineralization to form a cement line matrix. It also promoted the
      differentiation of osteogenetic cells, secretion of collagen overlying on the
      cement line matrix, inducing an earlier and more pronounced bone matrix
      formation. The cement line matrix wrapped the HA nanorods and filled the interrod
      spaces of the HAT coating, forming strong interdigitation at the bone-coating
      interface, and therefore, yielding enhanced osseointegration by means of contact 
      osteogenesis. Due to the considerably reduced corrosion of Mg by the pores-sealed
      bilayer structure of HAT coating, HAT-coated Mg maintained the mechanical
      integrity for a longer duration than PEO0-coated and bare Mg. It is clarified
      that the degradation of MgO and HA, rather than delamination, was the vanishing
      mode of PEO0 and HAT coatings during long-term implantation, avoiding osteolysis 
      induced by the delamination-generated particles.

TI  - Long-term biological complications of dental implants placed either in pristine
      or in augmented sites: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 294-310
LID - 10.1111/clr.13123 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate and compare the prevalence of biological complications and
      failure of implants placed in pristine vs. augmented sites after a mean
      observation period of at least 10 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The focused
      question "In patients with osseointegrated dental implants, are there differences
      in biological complications and implant failure at implants placed in pristine
      vs. augmented sites?" was addressed using the Population, Exposure, Comparison
      and Outcome criteria. Electronic and manual searches supplemented by the
      screening of the grey literature were carried out. A case definition of
      peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis had to be specified. The binary
      random-effects method was chosen to conduct meta-analyses. Results are presented 
      as Forest plots with weighted mean values and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The 
      I(2) statistic test was applied to quantify heterogeneity. The Newcastle-Ottawa
      Scale and the parameters provided in the Cochrane Center and CONSORT statement
      were used for quality assessment. The results are reported according to the
      PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: No randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing the
      outcomes of implants placed in pristine vs. augmented sites was identified. Five 
      case-series studies, one case-control study, one cross-sectional study and one
      RCT were eligible for qualitative and quantitative analyses. No statistically
      significant differences (p > .05) were observed between implants placed in
      pristine vs. augmented sites for any outcome variables both at patient and at
      implant levels, respectively. High heterogeneity concerning patient sampling,
      case definitions of biological complications and eligibility criteria was
      observed. CONCLUSION: The studies included in the present systematic review did
      not directly address the focused questions. Hence, the outcomes of the
      meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to high variability with
      respect to study design.

AB  - To control the bio-absorption rate of Mg alloy and improve its biocompatibility, 
      a BMP-2 of various concentrations (20, 50, and 100 ng/mL) was immobilized in the 
      carrier layer formed by micro-arc oxidation + hydrothermal treatment on the
      surface of Mg alloy. Their morphological and chemical properties were evaluated
      by FE-SEM with EDS and XRD. The electrochemical corrosion behavior was examined, 
      and the cytotoxicity was assessed by WST and ALP assay. After in vivo test during
      2 and 4 weeks in the rat tibia, histological observation was performed. In the
      carrier layer, calcium phosphate ceramic and oxide layers (MgO and Mg(OH)2) were 
      formed. The layers enhanced the corrosion resistance. It was maintained even
      after loading the BMP-2. In the BMP-2-loaded group, the proliferation and
      differentiation of the osteoblast cells were promoted by the continuous release
      of the BMP-2. After implantation for 2 weeks, all BMP-2-loaded groups showed
      better biodegradation rate and osseointegration than the control group. After 4
      weeks, the group with 50 ng/mL of BMP-2 exhibited the slowest biodegradation rate
      of all the BMP-2-loaded groups. This effected on the enhancement of new bone
      formation and the stable bone growth. Therefore, for the short term of
      implantation, this double coating method could be applied onto biodegradable Mg
      metal as an orthopedics and dental implant. For the long term of implantation
      over 4 weeks, to treat Mg implant with 50 ng/mL of BMP-2 was determined to be
      optimal.

AB  - Oral rehabilitation with osseointegrated implants is frequently the best

      achievement of excellent function and esthetics. In the case of maxillary or
      mandibular atrophy, extensive grafting may be necessary before implants can be
      properly placed. This is a case of maxillary reconstruction with autogenous iliac
      crest bone grafts, followed by placement of guided implants. After integration of
      the grafts, planning and insertion of implants allowed installation of an
      implant-supported prosthesis, recovering the morphology, function, and esthetics.

AB  - This study is based on an analysis of the results of treatment of 21 patients
      with mandibular defects of different localization and etiology who underwent
      reconstruction with fibula free flap. Postoperative clinical and radiographic
      controls were made regularly, the criteria for implant success were assessed.The 
      postoperative evolution of the patients was favorable, with the integration of
      the fibula vascularized grafts. Complete engraftment of bone autografts and wound
      healing was obtained in all observations. In all 21 patients, fibula flaps
      provided adequate conditions for implant placement. The coefficient of
      osteointegration of implants 3 years after bone grafting was 97%.Using a
      vascularized autograft from the fibula to replace the defects of the lower jaw
      provides the conditions for a full rehabilitation of patients. The methods of
      reconstructive surgery and implantation make it possible to successfully perform 
      the replacement of defects in the maxillofacial region, being one of the methods 
      medical and social rehabilitation of patients with this pathology.

AB  - To avoid dental implant-related infections and to promote the osseointegration of
      titanium implants, the application of silicon and chitosan containing coatings is
      proposed. Silicon is a well-known osteogenic element and chitosan was selected to
      confer the antibacterial properties. The synthesis of hybrid silica-chitosan
      coatings using the sol-gel process is presented and the characterization using
      (29)Si-NMR to verify the correct formation of the network is discussed. The (13)C
      NMR spectroscopy was used to confirm the covalent union between chitosan and the 
      silicon network. Hydrolytic degradation and silicon release studies showed the
      effective silicon release from the hybrids and, hence, the possibility to promote
      bone formation. The introduction of different amounts of chitosan and tetraethyl 
      orthosilicate (TEOS) modulated the Si release. The analysis of cell cultures in
      vitro demonstrated that the hybrid coatings were not cytotoxic and promoted cell 
      proliferation on their surfaces. The coatings containing 5%-10% chitosan had
      substantial antibacterial properties.

TI  - Marginal soft tissue stability around conical abutments inserted with the one
      abutment-one time protocol after 5 years of prosthetic loading.
PG  - 976-982
LID - 10.1111/cid.12683 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Soft tissue stability is crucial to obtain and maintain optimal
      esthetic results. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate, over 5 years, the
      soft tissue response using a conical abutment together with the "one-abutment
      one-time" (OA-OT) protocol in the restoration of implants inserted in the
      anterior esthetic area. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 2011 to January 2012, 
      all consecutive patients requiring an implant n the maxillary area between
      canines were enrolled. After submerged healing and osseointegration, a definitive
      abutment with a provisional crown was inserted. After 1 month, the definitive
      crown was delivered (Tdef). Analog impressions were taken before tooth extraction
      (T0), at implant insertion Timpl, and Tdef, and at 12 months (T1) and 60 months
      (T5). Casts were scanned and superimposed using a dedicated software. Differences
      in vertical height of soft tissue margins between the digitized model casts were 
      calculated and paired sample t test was conducted to compare results. To detect
      the potential role of biotype, groups (thick vs. thin) were compared by analysis 
      of variance with general linear model. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were
      enrolled. Three patients dropped out. At the 60-month, 22 patients (12 men and 10
      women with mean age of 68.3 +/- 11 years) concluded the study follow-up.
      Horizontal changes demonstrated gain of 1.06 mm at Timpl, 0.94 mm at Tdef, 0.92
      mm at T1 and 0.97 mm at T5 compared to T0. Vertical changes demonstrated gain of 
      0.84 mm at Timpl, 0.11 mm at Tdef, 0.29 mm at T1 and 0.59 mm at T5 compared to
      T0. The analysis of variance showed a significant better performance of thick
      biotype in soft tissue horizontal width (P = .022). No statistical differences
      were noticed for vertical width (P = .111). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a conical
      abutment together with the OA-OT approach allowed longitudinal stable soft tissue
      dimensions.

AB  - Osseointegration of dental implants is affected by osteoporosis. The purpose of
      this study was overcome the implant failure and facilitate the osseointegration
      of dental implants by c-myb in ovariectomized (OVX)-induced osteoporosis. c-myb
      is a transcription factor and supports bone formation. Plasmid DNA/c-myb
      conjugated with chitosan-gold nanoparticles (Ch-GNPs/c-myb) promoted osteogenesis
      and inhibited osteoclastogenesis in MC-3T3 E1 cells. Ch-GNPs/c-myb involved the
      reduction of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1, c-Fos, and
      tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated osteoclasts in
      receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) stimulated bone marrow
      macrophages. In vivo results of rat mandibles demonstrated Ch-GNP/c-myb-coated
      titanium (Ti) implants increased the volume and density of newly formed bone and 
      the osseointegration of dental implant with bone by micro computed tomography
      examination after OVX-induced osteoporosis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed
      increased c-myb expression and upregulation of bone morphogenic proteins,
      osteoprotegerin and EphB4, as well as the downregulation of RANKL by
      Ch-GNP/c-myb-coated Ti implants. Hematoxylin and Eosin staining expressed new
      bone formation by Ch-GNP/c-myb-coated Ti implants. Our findings indicated that
      c-myb delivered by Ch-GNPs supports osseointegration of dental implant even in
      osteoporotic condition. c-myb may be applicable to support dental implant
      integration and treatment in age-dependent bone destruction disease.

TI  - Systematic review of the safety and efficacy of osseointegration prosthesis after
      limb amputation.
PG  - 1731-1741
LID - 10.1002/bjs.11005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osseointegration, an approach for direct skeletal attachment of a
      prosthesis to an amputated limb, may address many of the problems associated with
      socket prostheses. The safety of osseointegration remains uncertain. The aim of
      this study was to summarize evidence on functional and clinical outcomes, as well
      as adverse effects of osseointegration for patients with a limb amputation.
      METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched
      to April 2018. Eligible studies were observational, case and qualitative studies,
      and RCTs conducted in patients with a limb amputation, who were managed with
      osseointegrated prostheses and had follow-up data. RESULTS: Twenty-two eligible
      articles comprising 13 unique studies were included. No RCT was identified. Apart
      from three case reports that comprised one to five patients, the sample size of
      studies ranged from 11 to 100 participants. All relevant studies reported
      improvement in functional outcomes (walking ability, prosthetic use and
      mobility), satisfaction and quality of life following osseointegration, compared 
      with their preoperative status or when using a conventional socket prosthesis.
      Infection rates ranged from 1 (95 per cent c.i. 0 to 5) to 77 (59 to 88) per
      cent. The majority of infections were described as low-grade soft tissue or
      superficial infections related to the skin-implant interface, and were treated
      effectively with antibiotics. None of the studies reported additional amputation 
      or death as a result of osseointegration. CONCLUSION: Osseointegration after limb
      amputation improves prosthetic use, comfort when sitting, walking ability,
      mobility, gait and quality of life. However, it is associated with an increased
      risk of soft tissue infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the implant failure, marginal bone loss (MBL), and other 
      biological or technical complications of restorations supported by tilted and
      straight implants after at least 3 years in function. METHODS: Electronic and
      manual searches were performed in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and OpenGrey
      to identify clinical studies published up to December 2017. After duplicate study
      selection and data extraction, the risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I
      tool. Random-effects meta-analyses of relative risks (RRs) or mean differences
      (MD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were performed, followed by
      subgroup/sensitivity analyses and application of the GRADE approach. RESULTS: A
      total of 17 nonrandomized studies (eight prospective/nine retrospective) were
      included. The number of implants of the overall systematic review was 7,568
      implants placed in 1,849 patients supporting either full-arch or partial implant 
      prostheses. No difference in the failure of tilted and straight implants was seen
      (eight studies; 4,436 implants; RR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.70 to 1.28; p = 0.74), with
      the quality of evidence being very low due to bias and imprecision. Likewise, no 
      difference in MBL was seen between tilted and straight implants (16 studies;
      5,293 implants; MD = 0.03 mm; 95% CI = -0.03 to 0.10 mm; p = 0.32), with the
      quality of evidence being very low due to bias and inconsistency. Contradictory
      results regarding implant survival were found from prospective and retrospective 
      studies, which could indicate bias from the latter. CONCLUSIONS: Within the
      limitations of the present systematic review, no effect of implant inclination on
      implant survival or peri-implant bone loss was found.

AB  - The Board of EAO (European Association for Osseointegration) has discussed an
      initiative to explore the conditions to establish a Dental Implant Register. It
      was suggested to bring this issue to the EAO Consensus Conference 2018 for a
      discussion and to possibly propose relevant and manageable parameters. This
      article presents some select examples from quality registers in the medical
      field. Based on the experience of established registers, essentially in the
      medical field, factors considered to be of importance, if and when establishing a
      Dental Implant Register are introduced and discussed.

      systematic review.
PG  - 6-19
LID - 10.1111/clr.13275 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) on implant
      dentistry. The primary focused question was as follows: What are the clinical,
      histological, and radiographic outcomes of PRF administration for bone
      regeneration and implant therapy? METHOD: A systematic literature search
      comprised three databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane followed by a hand
      search of relevant scientific journals. Human studies using PRF for bone
      regeneration and implant therapy were considered and articles published up to
      December 31, 2017 were included. Eligible studies were selected based on the
      inclusion criteria. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and controlled clinical
      trials (CCT) were included. RESULTS: In total, 5,963 titles were identified with 
      the search terms and by hand search. A total of 12 randomized controlled trials
      (RCT) met the inclusion criteria and were chosen for data extraction. Included
      studies focused on alveolar ridge preservation after tooth extraction,
      osseointegration process, soft tissue management, bone augmentation, bone
      regeneration after sinus floor elevation and surgical peri-implantitis treatment.
      Overall, the risk of bias was moderate or unclear. Nine studies showed superior
      outcomes for PRF for any of the evaluated variables, such as ridge dimension,
      bone regeneration, osseointegration process, soft tissue healing. Three studies
      failed to show any beneficial effects of PRF. No meta-analysis could be performed
      due to the heterogeneity of study designs. CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate
      evidence supporting the clinical benefit of PRF on ridge preservation and in the 
      early phase of osseointegration. It remains unclear whether PRF can reduce pain
      and improve soft tissue healing. More research support is necessary to comment on
      the role of PRF to improve other implant therapy outcomes.

TI  - Frequency of infraposition and missing contact points in implant-supported
      restorations within natural dentitions over time: A systematic review with
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 309-325
LID - 10.1111/clr.13291 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to assess clinical evidence on 
      adverse effects of osseointegrated implants placed among natural teeth of a
      residual dentition. METHODS: Seven databases were searched without restrictions
      up to January 2018 for clinical studies on implant infraposition (IIP) or
      proximal contact point (PCP) loss to the adjacent teeth. After duplicate
      selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment according to the Cochrane
      guidelines, random-effects meta-analyses of odds ratios (OR) or mean differences 
      (MD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were performed, followed by
      meta-regression and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: A total of 27 nonrandomized
      studies with 1,572 patients (mean age 42.2 years/51.2% female) followed up to
      18.5 years after implant placement were included. The pooled %prevalence of IIP
      was 50.5% (nine studies; 95% CI = 26.3-74.5%), and the pooled IIP extent was 0.58
      mm (six studies; 95% CI = 0.33-0.83 mm), while IIP > 1 mm was seen for 20.8% of
      placed implants (five studies; 95% CI = 8.3-37.1%), and male patients were less
      prone to IIP than female patients (three studies; OR = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.10-0.88; 
      p = 0.03). The pooled %prevalence of PCP loss was 46.3% (nine studies; 95% CI =
      32.3-60.6%), with increase through observation time (two studies; OR = 1.09; 95% 
      CI = 1.03-1.16; p = 0.004) and predilection for mesial PCPs (five studies; OR =
      2.25; 95% CI = 1.06-4.77; p = 0.03). However, the quality of evidence was very
      low due to bias. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and doctors need to be aware that
      long-term adverse effects of dental implants among natural teeth can be observed 
      in terms of IIP and PCP loss to the adjacent teeth.

PG  - e897-e906
LID - 10.1097/MAO.0000000000002041 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with percutaneous bone anchored
      hearing implant (BAHI) loss. DATA SOURCES: Africa-Wide, Biosis, Cochrane, Embase,
      Global Health, LILACs, Medline, Pubmed, and Web of Science electronic databases. 
      STUDY SELECTION: All studies reporting on adult and/or pediatric patients with a 
      BAHI loss were identified. Retrieved articles were screened using predefined
      inclusion criteria. Eligible studies underwent critical appraisal for directness 
      of evidence and risk of bias. Studies that successfully passed critical appraisal
      were included for data extraction. DATA EXTRACTION: Extracted data included study
      characteristics (study design, number of total implants and implant losses,
      follow-up), patient characteristics (sex, age, comorbidities, previous
      therapies), and information regarding BAHI loss (etiology of loss, timing of
      occurrence). DATA SYNTHESIS: From the 5,151 articles identified at the initial
      search, 847 remained after title and abstract screening. After full text review, 
      96 articles were eligible. Fifty-one articles passed quality assessment, however,
      due to overlapping study population, 48 articles reporting on 34 separate
      populations were chosen for data extraction. Three hundred one implant losses
      occurred out of 4,116 implants placed, resulting in an overall implant loss
      occurrence rate of 7.3%. Failed osseointegration was responsible for most implant
      losses (74.2%), followed by fixture trauma (25.7%). Most losses due to failed
      osseointegration occurred within 6 months of the implantation. BAHI implant loss 
      occurred more frequently in pediatric patients (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: The
      current systematic review identified factors associated with BAHI loss. These
      factors should be considered when assessing patients' candidacy and when
      investigating reasons for impeded implant stability and loss.

TI  - Osseointegrated Transcutaneous Device for Amputees: A Pilot Large Animal Model.
PG  - 4625967
LID - 10.1155/2018/4625967 [doi]
AB  - Traditional above-the-knee amputation prosthetics utilize a stump-socket
      interface that is well-known for skin/socket problems, sitting difficulty, disuse
      osteopenia, and increased work of ambulation. As a result, we evaluated a novel
      osseointegrated transcutaneous implant in a large animal. The implant was
      designed to promote osseointegration at the bone-implant interface and minimize
      complications. As proof of concept, four Dorset sheep underwent a two-stage
      surgery for forelimb placement of an osseointegrated transcutaneous implant
      utilizing Compress(R) technology (Biomet, Inc., Warsaw, IN). Two sheep received a
      long anchor plug (90 mm long x 9 mm in diameter) and two received a short anchor 
      plug (46 mm long x 9 mm in diameter). Sixteen weeks after the initial surgery,
      the operative limbs, along with the attached implant, underwent radiographic and 
      histological analysis for osseointegration. Periprosthetic fractures occurred in 
      the two animals that received the longer internal prosthesis; one healed with
      splinting and the other animal underwent a second surgical procedure to advance
      the amputation site more proximal. No fractures occurred in the shorter internal 
      prosthesis group. There was no histological evidence of infection and none of the
      transcutaneous adapters failed. Bone-implant osseointegration was demonstrated in
      two of three limbs that underwent histological analysis. This unique implant
      demonstrated osseointegration without transcutaneous adapter failure, all while
      displaying minimal infection risk from the outside environment. Although it
      involved short-term follow-up in a limited number of animals, this pilot study
      provides a platform for further investigation into the valid concept of using
      Compress(R) technology as an endo-exo device.

TI  - The effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the osteogenic activity in
      osseointegration: a systematic review.
PG  - 30
LID - 10.1186/s40729-018-0141-7 [doi]
AB  - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used in implant dentistry for 
      management of post-operative pain. The objective of this systematic review was to
      analyse the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the osteogenic
      activity of osteoblasts with an emphasis on its effect on osseointegration. A
      systematic literature search for in vitro, animal models, and clinical trials was
      conducted using Ovid, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Articles
      published since the introduction of selective COX-2 inhibitors, between January
      1999 and July 2018, were selected. The integrated search followed the PRISMA
      statement with the following key terms: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug/s,
      titanium, osseointegration, and osteoblast. The review is registered at PROSPERO 
      database: CRD42016051448. The titles and abstracts of each research article in
      the initial search (n = 875) were independently screened by two reviewers. A
      third independent reviewer reviewed the articles that were included by one but
      excluded by the other reviewer. This resulted in the cataloguing of 79 full-text 
      manuscripts where the articles were assessed for the following criteria: the
      study investigates the effects of NSAIDs on osteoblasts, explores the COX pathway
      and its effect on osteogenic activity, and compares the effects of NSAIDs on
      osteoblasts with a control group. A total of 13 articles have been included for
      qualitative synthesis. There is a lack of consensus in the literature to
      explicitly conclude that there is a relationship between the use of
      post-operative NSAIDs and failed osseointegration; however, osseointegration does
      not appear to be negatively affected by NSAIDs in the human clinical studies.

TI  - The antidepressant drug, sertraline, hinders bone healing and osseointegration in
      rats' tibiae.
PG  - 1485-1497
LID - 10.1111/jcpe.13015 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are one of the most common
      antidepressant drugs. SSRI use is associated with increased risk of bone fracture
      and titanium implant failure. The aim of this in vivo study was to investigate
      the effect of SSRIs on osseointegration and bone healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      On a total of 24 Sprague-Dawley rats, a custom-made titanium implant was placed
      in the left tibia, while a unicortical defect was created in the right tibia.
      Rats were assigned randomly into two groups and received a daily dose of either
      sertraline (5 mg/kg) or saline. After two weeks, they were euthanized and bone
      healing and osseointegration were assessed by micro-CT and histology. RESULTS:
      Bone formation in bone defects was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in
      sertraline-treated rats (BV/TV = 20.67 +/- 11.98%) compared to the controls
      (BV/TV = 37.87 +/- 9.56%). Furthermore, the percentage of osseointegration was
      significantly lower (p < 0.05) in sertraline-treated rats (34.40 +/- 7.17%)
      compared to the controls (54.37 +/- 8.58%). CONCLUSION: Sertraline hinders bone
      healing and implant osseointegration.

TI  - Prevalence and risk indicators of peri-implant diseases in Spain.
PG  - 1510-1520
LID - 10.1111/jcpe.13017 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of peri-implant diseases in Spain, as well as the
      associated risk indicators. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study
      using a network of sentinel dentists, who randomly selected 10 patients with
      implants (placed, at least, 5 years before), which were clinically and
      radiographically evaluated. Case definitions were established for peri-implant
      mucositis [bleeding on probing (BOP) and no bone level >/=2 mm] and
      peri-implantitis (BOP plus bone level >/=2 mm). Potential predictor variables, at
      univariate and multivariate levels, were explored by means of binary logistic
      regression. RESULTS: A total of 49 sentinel dentists provided complete data from 
      474 implants in 275 patients. At implant level, prevalences for peri-implant
      mucositis and peri-implantitis were 27% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22-32) and 
      20% (95% CI: 15-24), respectively, with 17% of implants (14-21) with bone level
      >/=2 mm without BOP. At patient level, prevalences were 27% (22-32), 24% (19-29) 
      and 18% (13-22), respectively. In the multiple regression analysis, statistically
      significant associations for peri-implantitis (p < 0.10) were found for gender,
      peri-implant supportive therapy, implant location, diameter and surface, type of 
      prosthesis and access to interproximal hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      representative subject sample across Spain, the prevalence of peri-implant
      diseases was high (51%).

TI  - The implant surface and its role in affecting the dynamic processes of bone
      remodeling by means of distance osteogenesis: A comparative in vivo study.
PG  - 133-140
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6729 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate whether different surface modifications
      affect the dynamics of bone remodeling at the implant and the adjacent local
      bone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two dental implants with different surfaces 
      (smooth and rough control [smCtrl; rCtrl], smooth and rough + O2-plasma spray
      [smPlas; rPlas], smooth and rough + nanocrystalline SiO2-hydroxyapatite coating
      [ncSiO2HA] + O2-plasma spray [smNB-C; rNB-C]; each n = 12) were bilaterally
      inserted into the femora of 36 New Zealand white rabbits. Intravital fluorochrome
      labeling was performed to visualize the dynamics of bone formation. The
      objectives were quantification of bone-to-implant contact (BIC [%]) at 2 and 4
      weeks and the dynamic bone formation (dbf [%]) at the implants' adjacent local
      bone within 1, 2, and 3 weeks. RESULTS: After 2 weeks, BIC was significantly
      higher for both smNB-C (BIC: 59% +/- 2% SEM) and rNB-C (BIC: 66% +/- 3% SEM)
      compared with controls (BIC: 42% +/- 1% SEM; P < .005). After 4 weeks, BIC for
      rNB-C (65% +/- 2%) was superior to all test groups (BIC: 39% +/- 2% SEM; P =
      .012). Regarding dbf (%), neither within 1 (P = .88), 2 (P = .48), nor after 3
      weeks (P = .36) did any differences occur among the groups, even in accordance to
      the implant level. CONCLUSION: Although distance osteogenesis seems crucial for
      the development of secondary stability and thus of osseointegration, it
      apparently does not get affected by a bioactive ncSiO2HA surface coating.
      Changing the surfaces' release kinetics and composition may increase distance
      osteogenesis.

TI  - Immediate and early implant placement in single-tooth gaps in the anterior
      maxilla: A prospective study on ridge dimensional, clinical, and aesthetic
      changes.
LID - 10.1111/clr.13378 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This prospective study evaluated the impact of timing of placement
      (immediate and early) on the horizontal ridge dimensional changes, clinical, and 
      aesthetic outcomes of implants placed in single-tooth gaps in the anterior
      maxilla. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Implants were placed in single-tooth gaps in the 
      anterior maxilla of 30 patients, either immediately after extraction (Group A, n 
      = 15) or after a healing period of 4-8 weeks (Group B, n = 15). In both groups,
      implant placement was followed by a 3- to 4-month period of non-submerged
      healing, after which definitive crowns were placed. Study models were obtained
      before extraction (T0), at implant placement (T1), at the insertion of a
      definitive crown (T2), and 1-year thereafter (T3). Horizontal ridge dimensional
      changes were measured by superimposing the optical scans of the study models from
      different time-points. Radiographs and photographs were used to evaluate changes 
      in marginal bone levels and soft tissue recession. Aesthetic evaluation was
      carried out using the Pink and White Esthetic Score (PES and WES) indices.
      Patient-reported outcomes were measured using a subjective questionnaire.
      RESULTS: A 100% implant survival rate was observed in both groups after a 1-year 
      follow-up. Analysis showed a labial horizontal tissue dimensional change of 0.61 
      mm and 0.72 mm from T0 to T3 in Groups A and B, respectively. Acceptable PES
      values were observed in both groups (Group A: 9.40; Group B: 9.27) after the
      1-year follow-up period. No incidence of advanced mucosal recession was observed 
      between definitive crown insertion and 1-year follow-up in both groups. No
      significant changes were observed for all other measured variables at different
      time-points. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate and early placed implants in single-tooth
      gaps in the anterior maxilla showed similar ridge dimensional changes as well as 
      acceptable clinical, aesthetic, and patient-centred outcomes in the short-term
      (1-year follow-up).

TI  - Dental implants-associated release of titanium particles: A systematic review.
LID - 10.1111/clr.13372 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The presence of titanium (Ti) particles around dental implants has
      been reported in the literature for decades. The prospective presence of Ti
      debris on soft tissues surrounding dental implants has not been systematically
      investigated and remains to be explored. Hence, this review aimed to evaluate the
      origin, presence, characteristics, and location of Ti particles in relation to
      dental implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature searches were conducted by two 
      reviewers independently based on the PRISMA guidelines. The systematic review
      identified studies on Ti particles derived from dental implants. We evaluated
      several parameters, including anatomical location, and the suspected methods of
      Ti particles release. RESULTS: The search resulted in 141 articles, of which 26
      were eligible and included in the systematic review of the literature. The
      investigations reported Ti and metal-like particles in the soft (i.e., epithelial
      cells, connective tissue, and inflammatory cells) and hard (bone crest and bone
      marrow) tissues around the dental implants. Shape and size of the particles
      varied. The current literature reported a size range from 100 nm to 54 microm
      identified by multiple particles identification methods. CONCLUSION: Ti particles
      surrounding peri-implant tissues are a common finding. Peri-implantitis sites
      presented a higher number of particles compared to healthy implants. The
      particles were mostly around the implants and inside epithelial cells, connective
      tissue, macrophages, and bone. Various mechanisms were described as causes of Ti 
      release, including friction during implant insertion, corrosion of the implant
      surface, friction at the implant-abutment interface, implantoplasty, and several 
      methods used for implant surface detoxification.

TI  - Comparison of periprosthetic bone remodeling after implantation of anatomic and
      tapered cementless femoral stems in total hip arthroplasty: A prospective cohort 
      study protocol.
PG  - e12560
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000012560 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Current total hip arthroplasty (THA) implant usage trends favor
      cementless fixation, and plenty studies have demonstrated that numbers of
      cementless femoral stems are associated with excellent long-term survivorship and
      functional outcomes. Various types of cementless femoral stems have been
      developed and utilized in multiple applications, including straight, tapered,
      anatomic, customized, short, and even neck stems. All of these designs aimed to
      achieve maximal primary stability and promote osseointegration. Nevertheless,
      stress-shielding and periprosthetic bone loss continue to occur and remain
      critical issues in promoting long-term survivorship of THA. Considering anatomic 
      and tapered stems are the most popular cementless designs today, this prospective
      cohort study aimed to investigate the effect of stem design on stress-shielding
      and periprosthetic bone remodeling after implantation of an anatomic stem with
      proximal fixation (Ribbed Hip system; Waldemar Link, Hamburg, Germany) and the
      direct comparison to a fully coated tapered stem (LCU Hip system; Waldemar Link).
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study will comprise patients who
      receive primary unilateral THA with the Ribbed anatomic hydroxyapatite
      (HA)-coated stem or LCU tapered fully HA-coated stem. The changes in
      periprosthetic bone mineral density after insertion of Ribbed and LCU stem
      prostheses will be assessed by means of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in the
      periprosthetic region of interest according to Gruen and colleagues. Standard
      anteroposterior and lateral plain radiography will be performed for qualitative
      assessment of the periprosthetic bone remodeling. The following items will be
      analyzed or measured on follow-up radiographs to compare with the initial
      appearance on the radiographs taken immediately postoperatively: cortical
      thickness in each Gruen zone, fitness of the distal stem within the isthmus,
      femoral stem alignment, radiolucent line, reactive line, periosteal bone
      reactions, and subsidence. Biologic fixation and stability of the cementless
      implant will be evaluated using Engh grading scale, and heterotopic ossification 
      will be graded according to Brooker classification. Furthermore, Harris hip score
      and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Score will
      also be assessed for postoperative functional evaluation. These radiologic and
      clinical assessments will be taken postoperatively, at 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 
      5 years after surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by The
      First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University Ethics Committee. The
      study results will be disseminated at national and international conferences and 
      published in peer-reviewed journals. STUDY REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial

AB  - An innovative technique of casting the titanium implant alloys and its calcium
      phosphate coating using centrifugal casting method was proposed in the current
      study. This one-step, self-coating technique results in formation of functionally
      graded biomaterials (FGBMs) of calcium phosphate/Titanium alloys. Two groups of
      samples (Group 1 and Group 2) were prepared utilizing self-coated titaniumniobium
      (Ti-6Al-7Nb) and titanium- vanadium (Ti-6Al-4V) alloys respectively. The cast
      samples were then prepared for in-vitro cytocompatibility evaluation, in-vivo
      systemic toxicity and osseointegration evaluation. Cytocompatibility was examined
      in-vitro on human bone osteosarcoma cells (Saos-2). In-vivo surgical implantation
      of the samples in the mandible of the experimental dogs was correspondingly
      implemented. Tests for systemic toxicity, X-ray images, Dual Energy X-ray
      Absorptiometry (DEXA) and histopathological analysis were obtained for each dog's
      mandible sample. In-vitro cytocompatibility studies revealed high
      cytocompatibility of Group 2 in comparison to Group 1. In-vivo results proved
      safety of Group 2 as regards to systemic toxicity. On the other hand, results of 
      the X-ray images, DEXA and histopathological analysis revealed comparable
      osseointegration potential of both groups. These results suggest the use of
      Group2-FGBMs in dental implant manufacturing and prove that FGBMs prepared by
      centrifugal casting as self-coated implants have good biocompatibility and
      osseointegration capability.

LID - 10.1038/s42003-018-0074-y [doi]
AB  - Nanosurfaces have improved clinical osseointegration by increasing bone/implant
      contact. Neovascularization is considered an essential prerequisite to
      osteogenesis, but no previous reports to our knowledge have examined the effect
      of surface topography on the spatio-temporal pattern of neovascularization during
      peri-implant healing. We have developed a cranial window model to study
      peri-implant healing intravitally over clinically relevant time scales as a
      function of implant topography. Quantitative intravital confocal imaging reveals 
      that changing the topography (but not chemical composition) of an implant
      profoundly affects the pattern of peri-implant neovascularization. New vessels
      develop proximal to the implant and the vascular network matures sooner in the
      presence of an implant nanosurface. Accelerated angiogenesis can lead to earlier 
      osseointegration through the delivery of osteogenic precursors to, and direct
      formation of bone on, the implant surface. This study highlights a critical
      aspect of peri-implant healing, but also informs the biological rationale for the
      surface design of putative endosseous implant materials.

AB  - A series of new hyaluronan derivatives was synthesized and tested as an
      antibiotic release system by antibacterial and osseointegration assays.
      Specifically, partially sulphated hyaluronic acid (sHA) was functionalized with
      dopamine (DA). The DA moiety guarantees good performance as a binding agent for
      coating a titanium alloy surface; furthermore, the negatively charged sHA has
      bone regenerative effects and a high binding affinity for positively charged
      antibiotics. A sHA scaffold with a defined degree of sulphation (DS =2) was
      selected as a good compromise between a high negative charge density and poor
      heparin-like anticoagulant activity, while the degree of DA derivatization
      (17.1%mol) was chosen based on the absence of cytotoxic activity and the
      promotion of osteoblast proliferation. The titanium alloy coating was
      investigated indirectly using a fluorescent probe and directly by environmental
      scanning electron microscope (ESEM) analysis. Long-duration antibiotic release
      was demonstrated in vitro, and antibacterial efficacy against a Staphylococcus
      aureus culture was shown.

AB  - Implant surface properties are a key factor in bone responses to metallic bone
      implants. In view of the emerging evidence on the important role of osteoclasts
      in bone regeneration, we here studied how surface roughness affects osteoclastic 
      differentiation and to what extent these osteoclasts have stimulatory effects on 
      osteogenic differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. For this, we induced
      osteoclasts derived from RAW264.7 cell line and primary mouse macrophages on
      titanium surfaces with different roughness ( Ra 0.02-3.63 mum) and analyzed
      osteoclast behavior in terms of cell number, morphology, differentiation, and
      further anabolic effect on osteoblastic cells. Surfaces with different roughness 
      induced the formation of osteoclasts with distinct phenotypes, based on total
      osteoclast numbers, morphology, size, cytoskeletal organization, nuclearity, and 
      osteoclastic features. Furthermore, these different osteoclast phenotypes
      displayed differential anabolic effects toward the osteogenic differentiation of 
      osteoblastic cells, for which the clastokine CTHRC1 was identified as a causative
      factor. Morphologically, osteoclast potency to stimulate osteogenic
      differentiation of osteoblastic cells was found to logarithmically correlate with
      the nuclei number per osteoclast. Our results demonstrate the existence of a
      combinatorial effect of surface roughness, osteoclastogenesis, and osteogenic
      differentiation. These insights open up a new dimension for designing and
      producing metallic implants by considering the implant roughness to locally
      regulate osseointegration through coupling osteoclastogenesis with osteogenesis.

AB  - Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) has emerged as an alternative endosseous material
      to metal implants mainly because of its lack of allergic sensitivity and
      radiolucency, while maintaining similar mechanical properties with bone. However,
      a disadvantage of PEEK is its weak osseointegration ability compared with metal
      implants. To overcome this, we prepared a phosphate group-modified PEEK by plasma
      treatment and subsequent phosphorylation reaction. Plasma treatment and phosphate
      modification of PEEK changed its hydrophobic surface to a hydrophilic surface
      while maintaining the original surface topography and roughness. Phosphate
      modification increased the bioactivity of rat bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), 
      including proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and bone-like nodule
      formation; however, this effect was negligible in plasma-treated PEEK. In
      addition, phosphate modification attenuated the phenotypic polarization of
      lipopolysaccharide-primed RAW264.7 macrophages to an inflammatory phenotype,
      based on the finding that macrophages on phosphate-modified PEEK produced
      decreased levels of the inflammatory cytokine and increased levels of the
      anti-inflammatory cytokine. Finally, in an animal study, phosphate-modified PEEK 
      exhibited a doubled pullout force from the femur bone cavity compared with bare
      PEEK. Thus, we conclude that phosphate modification can significantly improves
      the implant-bone bonding strength of PEEK by enhancing BMSCs activity and
      reducing excessive inflammation.

TI  - Losartan reverses impaired osseointegration in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
LID - 10.1111/clr.13376 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is not only associated with cardiovascular diseases but
      also with alterations in bone quality. Hypertension therefore might be a risk
      factor for osseointegration. Preclinical studies suggest that losartan, an
      angiotensin II receptor blocker widely used to treat hypertension, has a
      beneficial effect in graft consolidation. Here, we determine the effect of
      hypertension and losartan on osseointegration. METHODS: We used spontaneously
      hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar albinus rats receiving losartan
      (30 mg/kg, p.o.) or left untreated. After 1 week, titanium miniscrews were
      inserted into the tibia. Sixty days after implantation, implant stability was
      evaluated by removal torque measurement considered the primary endpoint.
      Microcomputed tomography and histomorphometric analysis were secondary endpoints.
      RESULTS: Losartan increased the removal torque in the hypertensive SHR group to
      levels of the Wistar controls. While the cortical parameters of osseointegration 
      remained unchanged, losartan increased medullary bone formation. Microcomputed
      tomography revealed a higher bone volume per tissue volume and trabecular
      thickness in the SHR rats treated with losartan. Histomorphometric analysis
      further showed that losartan significantly increased the thickness of newly
      formed bone in medullary area in hypertensive SHR rats. Losartan did not
      significantly alter the parameters of osseointegration in normotensive rats.
      CONCLUSIONS: The data presented suggest that the angiotensin II receptor
      antagonist losartan increases the medullary parameters of osseointegration in a
      tibia model of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Considering the study
      limitations, understanding the impact of hypertension and the respective drugs on
      osseointegration requires further research.

TI  - Effect of titanium surface functionalization with bioactive glass on
      osseointegration: An experimental study in dogs.
LID - 10.1111/clr.13375 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of surface
      functionalization with bioactive glass BSF18 on the osseointegration of
      sandblasted and dual acid-etched surface (AE) implants. METHODS AND MATERIALS:
      Forty Morse taper implants with an AE surface as controls (C) or with an AE
      surface functionalized with BSF18 (BF) were placed in the mandibles of 10
      beagles. Implants were analyzed after 2 and 4 weeks of healing. Implant stability
      quotient (ISQ) values were registered immediately after installation and prior to
      sacrifice. Samples were analyzed for bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone
      density (BD). The characterization of BF implants included surface roughness
      analysis with atomic force microscopy and contact angle (CA) analysis to evaluate
      wettability. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test (p <
      0.05). RESULTS: Surface roughness was not affected by BF treatment. CA was lower 
      in the BF group compared to the C group. No significant difference was observed
      in ISQ values between surfaces (p = 0,231), irrespective of time. Significantly
      higher ISQ values were observed for both implants after 4 weeks when compared
      with baseline (p = 0.04). Significantly higher BIC (p = 0.011) and BD (p = 0.025)
      values were observed for the BF compared to the C group at 2 weeks. Significantly
      higher BIC (p = 0.030) and BD (p = 0.015) values for the C group were observed at
      4 weeks compared to 2 weeks. No significant difference was observed in the BF
      group between 2 and 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Implant functionalization with BSF18
      improved the wettability of the implant surface; enhancing BIC and BD at 2 weeks.

AB  - Titanium is widely used for biomedical applications, but little information is
      being delivered regarding the cellular/molecular mechanisms explaining their
      efficacy, mainly considering the effects of the Ti-released trace elements on
      pre-osteoblasts. We addressed this issue by investigating decisive intracellular 
      signal transduction able to modulate cytoskeleton rearrangement, proliferative
      phenotype and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We considered titanium
      grades IV and V, submitted or not to dual acid-etching (w/DAE or wo/DAE,
      respectively). Our results showed there is no cytotoxicity, preserving AKT
      involvement. Additionally, Ti-enriched medium promoted a diminution of the
      downstream signaling upon integrin activation (phosphorylating Rac1 and cofilin),
      guaranteeing a dynamic cytoskeleton rearrangement. Moreover, the low profile of
      ECM remodeling obtained in response to trace molecules released by Ti-based
      devices seems contributing to the osteoblast performance in mediating
      extracellular support to cell anchorage. This hypothesis was validated by the
      up-expression of ss1-integrin, src and Focal adhesion kinase (fak) genes, mainly 
      in response to titanium grade V. Proliferative phenotype showed an unbalance
      between cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and p15(INK4b)/p21(Cip1). In conjunction,
      we showed for the first time that trace elements from Ti-based biomedical devices
      provoke important modulation of the osteoblast biology, driving cell anchoring,
      viability, and proliferative phenotype. Certainly, these biological outcomes
      compromise implant osseointegration.

TI  - Preparing and immobilizing antimicrobial osteogenic growth peptide on titanium
      substrate surface.
PG  - 3021-3033
LID - 10.1002/jbm.a.36491 [doi]
AB  - The inherent bioinertness and potential bacterial infection risk are the two
      leading causes for Ti implant failure. To improve osseointegration and
      antibiosis, in this work, a novel antimicrobial osteogenic growth peptide was
      first synthesized by conjugating osteogenic growth peptide (OGP) and
      ciprofloxacin (CIP). Then, the synthetic antimicrobial peptide was immobilized
      onto Ti implant surface for chemoselective binding via the amide reaction.
      Thereafter, the capabilities of modified Ti implant on osseointegration and
      antibiosis were measured with cell experiments and antimicrobial activity in
      vitro. The results showed that antimicrobial osteogenic growth peptide (OGP-CIP) 
      was successfully prepared and grafted onto Ti implant surface. Moreover, the
      antimicrobial peptide-modified Ti implants could promote osteoblasts spreading
      and osteodifferentiation compared with unmodified Ti substrates. Meanwhile, in
      vitro bacteria studies (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) proved that
      the antibacterial property of antimicrobial peptide functionalized Ti implant was
      improved obviously. The method used in this work is a feasible and promising
      strategy to win the race against invading bacteria and accelerate bone
      integration in orthopedic implantation. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

TI  - Engineered titanium implants for localized drug delivery: recent advances and
      perspectives of Titania nanotubes arrays.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Therapeutics delivery to bones to treat skeletal diseases or
      prevent postsurgical infections is challenging due to complex and solid bone
      structure that limits blood supply and diffusion of therapeutics administered by 
      systemic routes to reach effective concentration. Titanium (Ti) and their alloys 
      are employed as mainstream implant materials in orthopedics and dentistry; having
      superior mechanical/biocompatibility properties which could provide an
      alternative solution to address this problem. Areas covered: This review presents
      an overview of recent development of Ti drug-releasing implants, with emphasis on
      nanoengineered Titania nanotubes (TNTs) structures, for solving key problems to
      improve implants osseointegration, overcome inflammation and infection together
      with providing localized drug delivery (LDD) for bone diseases including cancer. 
      Critical analysis of the advantages/disadvantages of developed concepts is
      discussed, their drug loading/releasing performances and specific applications.
      Expert opinion: LDD to bones can address many disorders and postsurgical
      conditions such as inflammation, implants rejection and infection. To this end,
      TNTs-Ti implants represent a potential promise for the development of new
      generation of multifunctional implants with drug release functions. Even this
      concept is extensively explored recently, there is a strong need for more
      preclinical studies using animal models to confirm the long-term safety and
      stability of TNTs-Ti implants for real-life medical applications.

TI  - Interfacial biomechanical properties of a dual acid-etched versus a chemically
      modified hydrophilic dual acid-etched implant surface: an experimental study in
      Beagles.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s40729-018-0139-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high survival clinical success rates of osseointegration are
      requisites for establishing a long-term biomechanical fixation and load-bearing
      potential of endosseous oral implants. The objective of this preclinical animal
      study was to evaluate the effect of surface microtopography and chemistry on the 
      early stages of biomechanical rigidity with a sandblasted, dual acid-etched
      surface, with or without an additional chemical modification (SAE-HD and SAE,
      respectively), in the tibia of Beagle dogs. METHODS: Two pairs of implants, with 
      the same macrogeometry but different surface technology ((a) dual acid-etched
      surface treatment with hydrochloric and sulfuric acid followed by microwave
      treatment and insertion in isotonic saline solution to increase hydrophilicity
      (SAE-HD) (test, n = 12) and (b) dual acid-etched surface (SAE) (control, n =
      12)), were installed bilaterally in the proximal tibia of six Beagle dogs. In
      order to determine the effect of surface modification on biomechanical fixation, 
      a test protocol was established to assess the torque and a complete set of
      intrinsic properties. Maximum removal torque (in N cm) was the primary outcome
      measure, while connection stiffness (N cm/rad) and removal energy (x 10(-2)J)
      were the secondary outcome measures and were assessed after 2 and 4 weeks in
      vivo. A general linear statistical model was used and performed for significant
      differences with the one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc test (P < 0.05).
      RESULTS: The removal torque values did not reveal significant statistical
      differences between SAE-HD and SAE implants at any observation times (P = 0.06). 
      Although a slight increase over time could be observed in both test and control
      groups. SAE-HD showed higher removal energy at 4 weeks (999.35 +/- 924.94 x 10(- 
      2) J) compared to that at 2 weeks (421.94 +/- 450.58 x 10(- 2) J), while SAE
      displayed lower values at the respective healing periods (P = 0.16). Regarding
      connection stiffness, there were no significant statistical differences neither
      within the groups nor over time. There was a strong, positive monotonic
      correlation between removal torque and removal energy (=0.722, n = 19, P <
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, no significant differences were observed
      between the specific hydrophilic (SAE-HD) and hydrophobic (SAE) surfaces
      evaluated, in terms of biomechanical properties during the early osseointegration
      period.

TI  - The Cleating Stitch: An Adjunctive Technique for Percutaneous and Revision
      Osseointegration Screws.
PG  - 1285-1290
LID - 10.1097/MAO.0000000000002014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) has become a widely used and
      successful option in treatment of conductive and mixed hearing loss, and single
      sided deafness. Despite improvements in technique and cosmesis, complications
      remain that can result in implant revision or removal. Herein we describe a
      unique adjunctive technique, the cleating stitch, in placement of
      osseointegration screws and examine its impact on complication rates. STUDY
      DESIGN: Retrospective case review. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center.
      PATIENTS: A total of 66 implants in 65 patients (35 men, 30 women) with an
      average age of 54 years (15-81 yr). Average follow up 10.8 months. INTERVENTION: 
      All patients underwent BAHA implant placement by a single surgeon between April
      2012 and June 2017 using the linear incision or punch techniques with soft tissue
      reduction and placement of a cleating stitch. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Main outcome 
      measures include rates of revision surgery, overgrowth, extrusion, and Holgers
      reaction >/=2. Secondary outcome measures include associations between main
      outcome measures and outlying factors (obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus,
      coronary artery disease, age). RESULTS: The overall rate of revision was 3%, rate
      of overgrowth 1.5%, rate of extrusion 1.5%, and Holgers reaction >/=2 10.6%.
      Overgrowth and extrusion both required revision. Older age was associated with
      decreased risk of Holgers reaction >/=2 (p = 0.03) with a hazard ratio of 0.95
      (confidence interval 0.9-1.0). There were no other statistically significant
      associations between primary outcome measures and outlying factors. CONCLUSION:
      The cleating stitch is an effective adjunctive technique in placement of
      osseointegration screws associated with low rates of overgrowth and overall
      revision surgery.

TI  - Socket-shield technique: the influence of the length of the remaining buccal
      segment of healthy tooth structure on peri-implant bone and socket preservation. 
      A study in dogs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the location
      and length of root pieces on buccal peri-implant bone width and socket
      preservation in socket shield technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-eight dental
      implants (24 narrow and 24 regular platform internal hex implants) were placed in
      six dogs. The clinical crowns of teeth P2, P3, P4 and M1 were detached
      horizontally and removed from the underlying roots. Then the mesial root of each 
      tooth was extracted and the distal root was degraded using a high-speed
      hand-piece with round bur, creating a concave shell of dentin cementum and
      periodontal ligament (PDL) connected to the buccal aspect of the socket.
      Remaining root fragments of different lengths were created: coronal (1/3); middle
      and coronal (2/3); full length (3/3). These were positioned all around the bone
      crest. Implants were placed at the center of the root sockets, 1-3mm deeper than 
      the original root apex. RFA and histological evaluations were made at 4 and 12
      weeks. Data underwent statistical analysis (p<0.05). RESULTS: All 48 implants
      osseointegrated satisfactorily. On both buccal and lingual sides, the coronal
      (1/3) radicular fragment was attached to the buccal bone plate by physiologic
      periodontal ligament with less crestal bone resorption compared with middle (2/3)
      and whole root (3/3) groups for narrow and standard implants. CONCLUSIONS: Within
      the limitations of this study, the results demonstrate that a small piece of root
      in the coronal part of the alveolus can protect the buccal, mesial and distal
      bone crest following the immediate placement of NeO narrow or NeO Standard
      Internal Hex implants. The thickness of peri-implant bone and the remaining root 
      fragment together will provide a total thickness of >2mm. The technique would
      appear to be highly predictable, maintaining bone volume and reducing the risk of
      crestal bone resorption.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the third Summer Camp of European Association of
      Osseointegration (EAO), 40 junior representatives from various European societies
      and associations were brought together to discuss and explore the following
      topics in Implant Dentistry in the next 10 years: (I) certification, (II)
      societies and associations, (III) continuing education, and (IV) innovations.
      AIMS: The aims of all working groups were to identify and outline the present
      situation in the area of the selected topic and to propose improvements and
      innovations to be implemented in the following 10 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Four different groups were assigned randomly to one of the four working units.
      The method to discuss the selected topics was World Cafe. The summaries of four
      topics were then given to all participants for peer review. RESULTS AND
      CONCLUSIONS: All four groups presented the conclusions and guidelines
      accordingly: (I) The recognition for Implant Dentistry and accreditation of
      training programs would lead to an improvement of the quality of care to the
      benefit of the patients; (II) Dental associations and societies have to
      continuously improve communication to meet needs of dental students,
      professionals, and patients (III) European Dental Board should be installed and
      become responsible for continue dental education; (IV) dental engineering,
      peri-implant diseases, and digital workflow in dentistry currently have limited
      tools that do not guarantee predictable results.

TI  - Analysis of osseointegration of implants with hydrophilic surfaces in grafted
      areas: A Preclinical study.
PG  - 963-972
LID - 10.1111/clr.13361 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a hydrophilic
      surface on the osseointegration in grafted areas with deproteinized bovine bone
      (DBB) and with biphasic ceramics of hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate
      (HA/TCP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six rats were randomly allocated to four
      groups with 14 animals each: DBB: DBB+Machined surface; HA/TCP: HA/TCP+Machined
      surface; DBB-H: DBB+Hydrophilic surface; HA/TCP-H: HA/TCP+Hydrophilic surface.
      The bone defects were performed at the proximal epiphysis of the tibia. Then, the
      defects were filled with the biomaterials. After 60 days, the implants were
      placed in the grafted areas. The animals were submitted to euthanasia at periods 
      of 15 and 45 days after the implants' placement. The osseointegration was
      assessed by biomechanical, microtomographic, and histometric analyses. In
      addition, the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP), and osteocalcin (OCN) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
      RESULTS: The HA/TCP-H group presented higher removal torque values and more
      mineralized tissue in the vicinity of the implants compared with the HA/TCP
      group. The DBB-H and HA/TCP-H groups presented higher values of bone-implant
      contact (at 15 and 45 days), of bone between the threads (45 days), and
      expression of BMP-2 (45 days) than the DBB and HA/TCP groups. Furthermore, the
      DBB-H group presented a higher expression of ALP than the DBB group (15 days).
      CONCLUSION: In conclusion, implants with a hydrophilic surface improve
      osseointegration in grafted areas compared to implants with machined surfaces in 
      a rat tibia model.

      titanium coating on PEEK.

AB  - Polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) is one of the most common materials used for
      load-bearing orthopaedic devices due to its radiolucency and favorable mechanical
      properties. However, current smooth-surfaced PEEK implants can lead to fibrous
      encapsulation and poor osseointegration. This study compared the in vitro and in 
      vivo bone response to two smooth PEEK alternatives: porous PEEK and
      plasma-sprayed titanium coatings on PEEK. MC3T3 cells were grown on smooth PEEK, 
      porous PEEK, and Ti-coated PEEK for 14 days and assayed for calcium content,
      osteocalcin, VEGF and ALP activity. Osseointegration was investigated by
      implanting cylindrical implants into the proximal tibiae of male Sprague Dawley
      rats for 8 weeks. Bone-implant interfaces were evaluated using muCT, histology
      and pullout testing. Cells on porous PEEK surfaces produced more calcium,
      osteocalcin, and VEGF than smooth PEEK and Ti-coated PEEK groups. Bone ingrowth
      into porous PEEK surfaces was comparable to previously reported porous materials 
      and correlated well between muCT and histology analysis. Porous PEEK implants
      exhibited greater pullout force, stiffness and energy-to-failure compared to
      smooth PEEK and Ti-coated PEEK, despite Ti-coated PEEK exhibiting a high degree
      of bone-implant contact. These results are attributed to increased mechanical
      interlocking of bone with the porous PEEK implant surface. Overall, porous PEEK
      was associated with improved osteogenic differentiation in vitro and greater
      implant fixation in vivo compared to smooth PEEK and Ti-coated PEEK. These
      results suggest that not all PEEK implants inherently generate a fibrous response
      and that topography has a central role in determining implant osseointegration.

TI  - Micro-/nano-topography of selective laser melting titanium enhances adhesion and 
      proliferation and regulates adhesion-related gene expressions of human gingival
      fibroblasts and human gingival epithelial cells.
PG  - 5045-5057
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S166661 [doi]
AB  - Background: Selective laser melting (SLM) titanium is an ideal option to
      manufacture customized implants with suitable surface modification to improve its
      bioactivity. The peri-implant soft tissues form a protective tissue barrier for
      the underlying osseointegration. Therefore, original microrough SLM surfaces
      should be treated for favorable attachment of surrounding soft tissues. Material 
      and methods: In this study, anodic oxidation (AO) was applied on the microrough
      SLM titanium substrate to form TiO2 nanotube arrays. After that, calcium
      phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles were embedded into the nanotubes or the interval of
      nanotubes by electrochemical deposition (AOC). These two samples were compared to
      untreated (SLM) samples and accepted mechanically polished (MP) SLM titanium
      samples. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, X-ray
      diffraction, surface roughness, and water contact angle measurements were used
      for surface characterization. The primary human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs)
      and human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) were cultured for cell assays to determine 
      adhesion, proliferation, and adhesion-related gene expressions. Results: For
      HGECs, AOC samples showed significantly higher adhesion, proliferation, and
      adhesion-related gene expressions than AO and SLM samples (P<0.05) and similar
      exceptional ability in above aspects to MP samples. At the same time, AOC samples
      showed the highest adhesion, proliferation, and adhesion-related gene expressions
      for HGFs (P<0.05). Conclusion: By comparison between each sample, we could
      confirm that both anodic oxidation and CaP nanoparticles had improved
      bioactivity, and their combined utilization may likely be superior to mechanical 
      polishing, which is most commonly used and widely accepted. Our results indicated
      that creating appropriate micro-/nano-topographies can be an effective method to 
      affect cell behavior and increase the stability of the peri-implant mucosal
      barrier on SLM titanium surfaces, which contributes to its application in dental 
      and other biomedical implants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuroscientists commonly use permanently implanted headposts to
      stabilize the head of nonhuman primates (NHPs) during electrophysiology and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Here, we present improved
      methodology for MRI-compatible implants without the use of acrylic for head
      stabilization in NHPs. NEW METHOD: MRI is used to obtain a 3D-reconstruction of
      NHP skulls, which are used to create customized implants by modeling
      intersections with the bone. Implants are manufactured from PEEK using computer
      numerical control machining and coated with hydroxyapatite to promote
      osseointegration. Surgically, implants are attached to the skull with ceramic
      screws, while the skin flap is pulled over the implant and closed subcutaneously.
      RESULTS: Quality of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal is improved
      in animals implanted with our method as compared to traditional acrylic implants.
      Additionally, implants are well-integrated with the skull, remain robust for more
      than a year and without granulation tissue around the skin margin. COMPARISON
      WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Previous improvements on NHP implants (Chen et al.,
      2017; McAndrew et al., 2012; Mulliken et al., 2015; Overton et al., 2017) lacked 
      fMRI-compatibility, as they relied on titanium headposts and/or titanium screws. 
      Thus, most fMRI studies in NHPs today still rely on the use of acrylic-based
      headposts for stabilization and the use of contrast-enhanced agents to improve
      MRI signal. CONCLUSIONS: Our method preserves fMRI-compatibility and results in
      measurable improvement in BOLD signal without the use of contrast-enhanced
      agents. Furthermore, the long-term stability of our implants contributes
      positively to the wellbeing of NHPs in neuroscience research.

TI  - Effect of Photofunctionalization on Early Implant Failure.
PG  - 1098-1102
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6541 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study retrospectively evaluated the effects of bone density,
      staging strategy, implant stability, healing process, implant length, surface
      type, and photofunctionalization on early implant failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Consecutive study samples at Yokohama City University Hospital were analyzed for 
      their early implant failure potentially influenced by patient-, surgical
      protocol-, and implant-related factors. Through the screening process using
      univariate analysis for those factors, candidate influential factors such as bone
      density, staging strategy, the level of initial implant stability, postoperative 
      wound breakdown, the length of implants, the surface type of implants, and use or
      nonuse of photofunctionalization were selected as independent variables in
      forward multivariate logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio (OR) for
      candidate factors was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 563 implants placed in 219 
      patients from 2005 to 2017 were analyzed for their early implant failure.
      Stepwise logistic regression analysis finally identified postoperative wound
      breakdown (OR = 0.21) and the use of photofunctionalization (OR = 0.30) that
      significantly reduced the risk of early implant failure (P < .01 and P < .05,
      respectively). The implant failure rate was 10.0% with postoperative wound
      breakdown and 1.0% without it, whereas it was 4.3% without photofunctionalization
      and 1.3% with it. CONCLUSION: Among various patient-, surgical protocol-, and
      implant-related factors, the absence of postoperative wound breakdown and use of 
      photofunctionalization significantly reduced the risk of early implant failure.
      It was notable that photofunctionalization, a unique, chairside measure to
      improve implant surfaces, was effective exclusively among implant-related
      factors.

TI  - Vertical Bone Augmentation Using Ring Technique with Three Different Materials in
      the Sheep Mandible Bone.
PG  - 1057-1063
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6278 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the volumetric alterations and 
      osseointegration properties in the augmented area of the ring technique using
      different types of bone graft material in sheep mandible bone. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: Three different materials (columnar forms, 7-mm diameter, 3-mm height)
      were stabilized using dental implants with a turned surface in the mandible bone 
      of Finnish Dorset cross-bred sheep: group A, autogenous bone; group B, bovine
      bone; group C, biphasic bone substitute. Animals were euthanized after 5 weeks (N
      = 6). Three-dimensional image data by digital oral scanner were taken at the
      surgery and sacrifice, and the volume alteration of the material was calculated. 
      The bone samples were fixed in formalin and dehydrated in ethanol. Resin-embedded
      samples were subjected to non-decalcified ground sectioning, and histologic and
      histomorphometric analysis (bone and material area alteration, bone-to-implant
      contact [BIC]) were done. RESULTS: In three-dimensional (3D) image analysis,
      group A showed a statistically higher percentage of remaining materials compared 
      with groups B and C. The histologic observation showed no new bone formations
      around the implants in all groups, especially at the maxillary site of the
      implant in the augmented area. In histomorphometric analysis, group A showed a
      statistically higher percentage of bone area (BA) compared with groups B and C;
      however, in all groups, bone-to-implant contact (BIC) showed low values, and
      there were no statistical differences between groups. CONCLUSION: The results of 
      this study suggested that the autogenous bone maintained bone volume around the
      dental implant using the ring technique, and the impact of surface properties was
      of some importance; osseointegration with the turned surface in the augmented
      area showed low BIC values in all groups.

TI  - Control Variable Implants Improve Interpretation of Surface Modification and
      Implant Design Effects on Early Bone Responses: An In Vivo Study.
PG  - 1033-1040
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6436 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This in vivo study used control variable implants to compare early bone 
      responses in fluoride-modified (F-mod) and hydrophilic, sandblasted, large-grit, 
      acid-etched (modSLA) surface implants that differed in implant design. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Four different types of implants (n = 24) were prepared: F-mod
      surface with Astra Tech implant design; modSLA surface with Straumann implant
      design; sandblasted, large-grit, acid-etched (SLA) surface with Astra Tech
      design; and SLA surface with Straumann implant design. Scanning electron
      microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron
      spectroscopy were performed to assess implant surface characteristics. Four
      implants from each implant type were inserted in the tibiae of four rabbits that 
      were sacrificed 10 days after surgery. Bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone
      area (BA) were measured to evaluate early bone responses. Analysis of variance
      with Tukey's multiple comparison method was used for the histomorphometric data
      to find any significant difference. The surface characteristic-related data were 
      analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of significance was .05 in
      statistical analyses. RESULTS: No significant differences in BIC and BA were
      found among the modified surfaces (P > .05), whereas significant differences were
      found in surface topography and surface chemistry. The different designs showed
      no significant effects on early bone responses when identical surface
      modifications were applied (P > .05). CONCLUSION: F-mod and modSLA surfaces
      showed no significant differences in early bone responses. Furthermore, the
      implant design had no influence on the bone response. This in vivo experimental
      model will help improve the evaluation of surface modification factors by
      allowing an independent estimation of one variable (surface modification) against
      a constant (implant design).

TI  - Effect of Plasma Oxidation-Treated TiOx Film on Early Osseointegration.
PG  - 1011-1018
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6680 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a TiOx film with high wettability using plasma oxidation
      methodology and to evaluate the effect of such surface modification on new bone
      formation and early osseointegration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty sandblasted
      and acid-etched (SLA) titanium implants layered with a TiOx film layer were
      modified by plasma oxidation using a Radio Frequency Plasma Enhanced Chemical
      Vapor Deposition (RFPECVD) system. Twenty SLA implants without any treatment were
      employed as the control group. Scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate 
      surface morphology of the coating. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was
      utilized to identify the chemical composition of the implant surface, and the
      wettability was tested with the help of the contact angle calculation. All
      implants were randomly inserted into the proximal tibia of 20 rats with a
      split-plot design. Four weeks after implantation, early osseointegration of the
      two groups was analyzed by a removal torque test and histologic analysis.
      RESULTS: The surface characteristics showed that both SLA and plasma
      oxidization-treated SLA (PO-SLA) surfaces displayed similar typical isotropic
      irregular indentations. As revealed by the XPS analyses, both TiO2 and Ti2O3 were
      coexistent in the PO-SLA surface. The contact angle measurement revealed that the
      super-hydrophilic surface was created out in the PO-SLA surface. Four weeks after
      implantation, a higher removal torque value was observed in the group of implants
      with the PO-SLA surface compared with the control group (12.68 +/- 1.07 vs 9.95
      +/- 1.42 Ncm, P < .05), and a higher rate of bone-to-implant contact was also
      detected in the same group of implants with the PO-SLA surface (47.79% +/- 9.59% 
      vs 39.41% +/- 9.00%, P < .05). The bone area ratio was also higher in the PO-SLA 
      surface group than the control group (39.10% +/- 10.01% vs 29.01% +/- 7.24%, P < 
      .05). CONCLUSION: It was indicated that the PO-SLA surface has combined the
      effect of high wettability and micro/nano-structures to notably increase early
      bone apposition.

TI  - A Novel Experimental Dental Implant Permits Quantitative Grading of
      Surface-Property Effects on Osseointegration.
PG  - 967-978
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6348 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis if a novel single-chamber experimental dental
      implant allows in vivo the quantitative assessment of osseointegration over time 
      and as a function of different surface properties (physical, chemical, geometric,
      biologic [osteoconductive or osteoinductive]) in a biologically unfavorable
      environment (local osteoporosis). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three prototypes of a
      novel experimental implant with different chamber sizes (small, medium, and
      large) were compared with each other to find out the minimum size of bone
      chambers needed to allow a discriminative quantification of osseointegration over
      time. For the comparison of low and high surface osteoconductivity properties,
      conventional sandblasted, acid-etched chamber surfaces (low surface
      osteoconductivity) were compared with biomimetically (calcium phosphate) coated
      ones (high surface osteoconductivity). The implants (4 implants per animal; 88
      implants per time point) were inserted into the edentulous maxillae of a total of
      66 adult goats with a physiologically osteoporotic masticatory apparatus. Two, 4,
      and 8 weeks later, they were excised and prepared for a histomorphometric
      analysis of the volume of neoformed bone within the chamber space and of the
      bone-to-implant contact (BIC) area. RESULTS: The implants with small chambers did
      not show significant differences in bone coverage (BIC) nor bone volume (relative
      and absolute volume), neither as a function of time nor as of implant surface
      property (low versus high surface osteoconductivity). However, medium and large
      chambers revealed significant differences respecting both of these parameters
      over the 8-week postoperative time period. CONCLUSION: The new implant model
      permits a discriminative quantification of osseointegration in vivo in an
      osteoporotic bone environment for implants with medium-sized and large-sized
      chambers. Quantitative assessment of osseointegration is possible, both over time
      and as a function of low and high surface osteoconductivity properties.

TI  - Septic Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty: Treatment of Metaphyseal Bone Defects
      Using Metaphyseal Sleeves.
PG  - 3734-3738
LID - S0883-5403(18)30721-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.arth.2018.08.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone loss is a severe problem in septic revision total knee
      arthroplasty (RTKA). The use of porous coated metaphyseal sleeves is a promising 
      treatment option for metaphyseal bone defects. The currently published midterm
      results remain limited and no study has been focused exclusively on septic cases.
      Our aim was to determine the implant survivorship (with special focus on
      osseointegration) and the clinical and radiological midterm outcome of
      metaphyseal sleeve fixation in septic RTKA surgery (minimum follow-up of 2
      years). METHODS: We performed a clinical and radiographic examination of 56
      patients with a history of prosthetic joint infection who underwent 2-stage RTKA 
      with the use of porous coated metaphyseal sleeves. These examinations included
      evaluation of the American Knee Society Score, the Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index, the Short Form (SF-36) Health survey as well
      as radiographic measurement to determine whether successful osseointegration had 
      been achieved. RESULTS: Nine patients (16%) had to be re-revised at the time of
      follow-up (mean, 5.3 years; range, 2-11.2), all due to reinfection. We did not
      encounter any cases of aseptic loosening. The mean range of motion (92 degrees , 
      SD +/- 21 degrees ), subjective satisfaction score (7, SD +/- 2), American Knee
      Society Score (76, SD +/- 19), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
      Osteoarthritis Index (70, SD +/- 20), SF-36 mental component summary (55, SD +/- 
      14), and SF-36 physical component summary (35, SD +/- 9) have shown satisfying
      results. CONCLUSION: Metaphyseal sleeves have shown very promising midterm
      results regarding clinical scores, osseointegration, and aseptic loosening. Our
      results are the first analyzing exclusively septic indications and indicate that 
      they are a reliable fixation option in all bone defect types in septic RTKA
      patients.

TI  - Effect of lycopene on titanium implant osseointegration in ovariectomized rats.
PG  - 237
LID - 10.1186/s13018-018-0944-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lycopene prevents bone loss in osteopenic models. However, the role
      of lycopene in the success rate of dental implants under osteopenic conditions
      remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether lycopene prevents 
      delayed implant osseointegration in an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model. METHODS:
      Thirty female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following
      groups: OVX with vehicle (OVX group), OVX with lycopene (OVX + lycopene group)
      and sham-operated with vehicle (sham group). Twelve weeks after ovariectomy or
      sham operation, titanium implants were placed into the distal metaphysis of the
      bilateral femurs of each rat. These rats were subsequently gavaged with lycopene 
      (50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. After 12 weeks of gavage, all rats were sacrificed,
      and specimens were harvested. Sample osseointegration was evaluated by
      biomechanical testing, 3D micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis and
      histomorphometric analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the OVX group, the OVX +
      lycopene group showed a 69.3% increase in the maximum push-out force (p < 0.01). 
      Micro-CT data for the femurs in the OVX + lycopene group showed significantly
      higher bone volume, trabecular thickness and less trabecular space than did those
      in the OVX group. The bone area (BA) around the implant and bone contact (BC)
      with the implant were increased by 72.3% (p < 0.01) and 51.4% (p < 0.01) in the
      OVX + lycopene group, respectively, compared with those in the OVX group. There
      was no significant difference in the mechanical test, micro-CT scanning and
      histomorphometric data between the OVX + lycopene and sham groups (p > 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: Lycopene improved implant osseointegration, fixation and bone
      formation under osteopenic conditions, suggesting that lycopene is a promising
      therapeutic agent to prevent delayed implant osseointegration and bone loss under
      osteopenic conditions.

TI  - Model-based roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis using elementary geometrical 
      shape models: 10 years results of an uncemented acetabular cup component.
PG  - 335
LID - 10.1186/s12891-018-2259-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-cemented acetabular cup components demonstrated different
      clinical performance depending on their surface texture or bearing couple.
      However, clinical osseointegration needs to be proved for each total joint
      arthroplasty (TJA) design. Aim of this study was to detect the in vivo migration 
      pattern of a non-cemented cup design, using model-based roentgen
      stereophotogrammetric analysis with elementary geometrical shape models (EGS-RSA)
      to calculate early cup migration. METHODS: Interchangeable applicability of the
      model-based EGS-RSA method next to gold standard marker-based RSA method was
      assessed by clinical radiographs. Afterwards, in vivo acetabular cup migration
      for 39 patients in a maximum follow up of 120 months (10 years) was calculated
      using model-based EGS-RSA. RESULTS: For the axes with the best predictive
      capability for acetabular cup loosening, mean (+/-SD) values were calculated for 
      migration and rotation of the cup. The cup migrated 0.16 (+/-0.22) mm along the
      cranio-caudal axis after 24 months and 0.36 (+/-0.72) mm after 120 months,
      respectively. It rotated - 0.61 (+/-0.57) deg. about the medio-lateral axis after
      24 months and - 0.53 (+/-0.67) deg. after 120 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Interchangeable applicability of model-based EGS-RSA next to gold standard
      marker-based RSA method could be shown. Model-based EGS-RSA enables an in vivo
      migration measurement without the necessity of TJA specific surface models.
      Migration of the investigated acetabular cup component indicates significant
      migration values along all the three axes. However, migration values after the
      second postoperative year were within the thresholds reported in literature,
      indicating no risk for later aseptic component loosening of this TJA design.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of modified transalveolar sinus floor elevation and osteotome
      sinus floor elevation in posterior maxillae: study protocol for a randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 489
LID - 10.1186/s13063-018-2879-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implant placement in the posterior maxilla is often complicated by
      the insufficient bone volume. While transalveolar sinus floor elevation (TSFE)
      has been proven as a predictable surgical procedure to increase the bone height
      in the posterior maxilla, questions in regard to the necessity of the bone
      grafting during the sinus lift and the question of whether TSFE could be
      performed when the residual bone height is below 5 mm are still debated.
      Furthermore, high-quality evidence comparing the clinical outcome of
      transalveolar sinus floor elevation with osteotome and modified sinus floor
      elevation with crestal non-cutting drills is limited. METHODS/DESIGN: One hundred
      twenty adult patients who fit the inclusion criteria are being recruited from the
      Peking University Hospital of Stomatology First Clinical Division (Beijing,
      China). All patients are assigned to one of four groups according to a table of
      random numbers. Participants will receive (1) TSFE using osteotomes with bone
      grafting, (2) TSFE using osteotomes without bone grafting, (3) modified TSFE with
      bone grafting, or (4) modified TSFE without bone grafting. In a one-year
      follow-up period, implant survival rates, complications, implant stability, bone 
      remodeling around the implant, and patient-reported outcome (visual analog scale 
      for intraoperative discomfort and postoperative pain) will be observed and
      documented. The implant stability will be gauged by the resonance frequency
      analysis six times (at baseline and weeks 6, 8, 12, 16, and 26), and the bone
      remodeling will be observed and compared via radiographic examinations.
      DISCUSSION: The result of the trial will potentially contribute to better
      decision making in atrophic posterior maxilla when implant placement is needed.
      Therefore, if the outcome is deemed favorable, the use of the modified TSFE would
      achieve an outcome equivalent to that of the traditional TSFE while introducing
      less trauma and postoperative discomforts. Separately, whether the bone graft
      procedure is necessary for the TSFE will also be discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      The study has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier number
      NCT03445039 . Registered on 26 February 2018.

TI  - Computed tomography color mapping for evaluation of bone ongrowth on the surface 
      of a titanium-coated polyetheretherketone cage in vivo: A pilot study.
PG  - e12379
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000012379 [doi]
AB  - Bone ongrowth on the surfaces of titanium (Ti)-coated polyetheretherketone (PEEK)
      materials has been demonstrated in animal models; however, whether this occurs on
      the surfaces of Ti-coated PEEK cages in lumbar interbody fusion has not been
      demonstrated clinically in vivo. This prospective observational study was aimed
      to develop and validate a computed tomography (CT) color mapping based on
      Hounsfield unit (HU) values for evaluation of bone ongrowth on the surfaces of
      the Ti-coated PEEK cage after posterior lumbar interbody fusion
      (PLIF).Twenty-four consecutive patients (11 men and 13 women; mean age, 67.0
      years; range, 20-82 years) who underwent single- or 2-level PLIF since March 2015
      were included. Two Ti-coated PEEK cages were inserted in all PLIF segments. From 
      reconstructed sagittal planes from postoperative CT scans (within 1 week and 6
      months postoperatively), bone ongrowth on the surfaces of cage frames was
      evaluated by CT color mapping. Inter- and intraobserver reliability of the
      assessment of bone ongrowth by CT color mapping was evaluated by Cohen's kappa
      coefficient. The relation between CT color mapping and HU values on the surfaces 
      of cage frames was also analyzed.A total of 248 surfaces of cage frames were
      evaluated. Bone ongrowth was observed in 134 of 248 surfaces (54.0%) by CT color 
      mapping. Intraobserver reliability for the evaluation of bone ongrowth was kappa 
      = 0.831, and interobserver reliability was kappa = 0.713. The HU values in the
      local regions of interest (ROIs) on the surfaces of cage frames where the
      postoperative bone ongrowth existed on CT color mapping increased significantly
      postoperatively (P < .001), and the median postoperative change rate of the HU
      values in the local ROIs was 22.4%.The assessment of bone ongrowth on the
      surfaces of Ti-coated PEEK cages by CT color mapping had adequate inter- and
      intraobserver reliability, which was useful especially in detecting local
      increase in HU values on the surfaces of the cages. This method is an easy and
      visually comprehensible method for the assessment of bone ongrowth in the
      bone-implant interface.

TI  - E7 peptide-functionalized Ti6Al4V alloy for BMSC enrichment in bone tissue
      engineering.
PG  - 2480-2490
AB  - Ti6Al4V alloy is widely used for hip joint prostheses, however owing to its lack 
      of biomimetic surface properties, it often suffers from poor osseointegration. It
      is well known that bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) play an important role in 
      the osseointegration of the host bone and joint prostheses. One promising
      approach to improving the osseointegration of joint prostheses is to enrich the
      number of BMSCs at the periprosthetic site. Previous studies have reported that
      BMSC specific affinity peptide E7, can specifically enrich BMSCs. However, to
      date, few studies have reported the use of E7 in bone tissue engineering. In this
      study, we conjugated E7 peptide to Ti6Al4V alloy to fabricate a scaffold (BTS) to
      improve the biocompatibility of the alloy. E7 peptide efficiently improved the
      adhesion of BMSCs to Ti6Al4V alloy. In addition, the BTS scaffold was more
      conducive to osteogenesis than the RGD-functionalized and non-functionalized
      control scaffolds. The functional BTS scaffold could pave the way for designing
      functional joint prostheses, which promote osseointegration between the host bone
      and implant.

AB  - PURPOSE: This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of zirconia implants
      as well as regarding the outcome of the implant-restorative complex in
      preclinical studies. STUDY SELECTION: An electronic search of the literature
      prior to July 2017 was performed to identify all articles related to preclinical 
      research on zirconia implants. The search was conducted using MEDLINE (National
      Library of Medicine) and PubMed without restrictions concerning the date of
      publication. The search terminology included: zirconia implant, osseointegration,
      bone-to-implant contact, soft tissue, histology, histomorphometry, surface
      modification, surface roughness, surface characteristics, and restoration
      (connecting multiple keywords with AND, OR). RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies were
      finally selected from an initial yield of 654 titles, and the data were
      extracted. The identified preclinical studies focused on several aspects related 
      to zirconia implants, namely biocompatibility, mechanical properties, implant
      design, osseointegration capacity, soft tissue response, and restorative options.
      Due to heterogeneity of the studies, a meta-analysis was not possible. The most
      frequently used zirconia material for the fabrication of implants is
      yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal. The resistance-to-fracture for
      zirconia implants ranged between 516-2044N. The mostly investigated parameter was
      osseointegration, which is compared to that of titanium. A lack of evidence was
      found with other parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Due to its good biocompatibility as
      well as favorable physical and mechanical properties, zirconia implants are a
      potential alternative to titanium implants. However, knowledge regarding the
      implant-restorative complex and related aspects is still immature to recommend
      its application for daily practice.

TI  - Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion Using Reaction Bonded Silicon Nitride Implants: 
      Long-Term Case Series of the First Synthetic Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion
      Spacer Implanted in Humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, a historical case series is reported of reaction
      bonded silicon nitride (Si3N4) implants for anterior lumbar interbody fusion
      (ALIF) for a patient population of 30 and surgery levels L3/4, L4/5, and/or
      L5/S1. Before the study, the only work on Si3N4 as a biomedical material was
      associated preliminary work, which involved animal trials using a rabbit model.
      The objective was to undertake the first use of Si3N4 as a biomedical material
      for humans, as an implant for ALIF. METHODS: The Si3N4 implants were prepared by 
      die-pressing silicon powder and reaction bonding in 95 N2/5 H2 at approximately
      1400 degrees C for approximately 50 hours. The surgeries involved a
      retroperitoneal approach for L3/4 and L4/5 levels and a transperitoneal approach 
      for L5/S1 level. The patient follow-up involved assessment of radiologic fusion
      up to 30 years and clinical outcomes to 10 years. RESULTS: The reaction bonded
      Si3N4 implants were found to be biologically safe and to show high fusion rates
      with minimal subsidence, no abnormal reaction, and no other complications. The
      primary outcome measure, visual analog scale back pain, improved from a
      preoperative mean of 8.4 (range, 6-10) to a mean of 3.7 (range, 0-9) at 5 years
      and a mean of 4.9 (range, 0-9) at 10 years. The Oswestry Disability Index
      improved from a preoperative mean of 48 (range, 26-84) to a mean of 35 (range,
      4-76) at 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that Si3N4 is biologically
      safe in the long-term, with capacity for excellent radiologic osseointegration.

TI  - A Prospective, Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Clinical Outcome of 
      Implant Treatment in Women with Osteoporosis/Osteopenia: 5-Year Results.
PG  - 84-90
LID - 10.1177/0022034518798804 [doi]
AB  - The impact of osteoporosis on implant treatment is still a matter of debate in
      the scientific community, as it may possibly lead to higher failure rates. As
      long-term controlled trials are missing, the aim of this study was to verify the 
      long-term outcome of implants placed in patients with systemic osteoporosis.
      Postmenopausal women in need of implants underwent bone mineral density
      measurements in hip and spine, using dual X-ray absorptiometry scans. Based on
      T-scores, they were divided into 2 groups: group O (osteoporosis group) with a
      T-score </=-2 or group C (control group) with a T-score of >/=-1. Implants were
      placed in a 2-stage manner and loaded 4 to 8 wk after abutment surgery. Six
      months after loading and thereafter yearly, clinical and radiographical
      parameters were assessed. In total, 148 implants were placed in 48 patients (mean
      age: 67 y [range, 59-83]). Sixty-three implants were placed in 20 patients (group
      O) and 85 implants in 28 patients (group C). After 5 y, 117 implants (38 in group
      O and 79 in the group C) in 37 patients were assessed. Cumulative survival rate
      on an implant level was 96.5% (group O: 91.5%; group C: 100.0% [ P < 0.05]) and
      95.7% (group O: 89.2%; group C: 100.0% [ P > 0.05]) on a patient level. The
      overall marginal bone-level alterations, after 5 y of loading, were -0.09 +/-
      0.78 mm (group O: -0.15 +/- 0.50 mm; group C: -0.06 +/- 0.89 mm) on an implant
      level and -0.09 +/- 0.54 mm (group O: -0.18 +/- 0.43 mm; group C: 0.06 +/- 0.58
      mm) on a patient level ( P > 0.05). Oral implant therapy in osteoporotic patients
      is a reliable treatment option with comparable osseointegration rates, implant
      survival, and marginal bone-level alterations after 5 y of functional loading
      (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00745121).

TI  - Long-term randomized clinical trial evaluating the effects of fixture surface
      acid-etching and machined collar design on bone healing.

LID - 10.3290/j.qi.a41013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: An implant with an acid-etched fixture surface and internal-hex
      collar may achieve greater osseointegration. The goal of this research was to
      study the effects on long-term bone healing of fixture surface acid-etching and
      machined collar design. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Three two-part implant types were
      compared: standard Branemark (with an external-hex 1.2 mm long machined flat
      collar), Swede-Vent (a copy of the Branemark design, with an identical collar but
      a fixture surface acid-etched to 1 to 3 microm), and Screw-Vent (with a fixture
      surface acid-etched identically to that of Swede-Vent, but a longer internal-hex 
      machined flat collar that did not require countersinking). Fifty-eight subjects
      each received the three types in alternate fashion at five sites between mental
      foramen, and a fixed full-arch prosthesis. Abutment-implant interface/microgap
      (MG) was placed at the crest, and first bone-to-implant contact point-to microgap
      (fBIC-MG) was measured at mesial and distal sides of each implant. Mean fBIC-MG
      values were compared after 15 to 20 years of function. Statistical analysis was
      based on the mixed linear model with the level of significance set at P < .05 and
      Bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: Branemark had less mean 
      marginal bone loss (-1.08 mm, standard error [SE] 0.20) compared with Swede-Vent 
      (-1.28 mm, SE 0.20), but pairwise comparisons showed that the difference was not 
      statistically significant (mean difference of 0.20 mm, P = .662). Screw-Vent had 
      the greatest loss (-1.92 mm, SE 0.20), and pairwise comparisons showed that the
      difference was statistically significant compared with Branemark and Swede-Vent
      (difference >/= 0.64 mm, P < .001). CONCLUSION: According to accepted standards
      for osseointegration, all three implant types achieved very acceptable long-term 
      results. However, while Branemark had the least bone loss, the implant with the
      acid-etched fixture surface and longer internal-hex collar design had the
      greatest loss. Within the confines of this study, shorter collar length of 1.2 mm
      may be more important to limit long-term bone loss with microgap placed at the
      crest.

TI  - Esthetic treatment of alveolar ridge atrophy in the anterior maxilla via
      connective tissue graft performed simultaneously with implant placement: A
      three-case series.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The mere osseointegration of an implant should no longer be considered
      a satisfactory criterion for success. Tooth extraction itself and, more
      importantly, possible local comorbidities such as periodontal or endodontic
      diseases, cause a reduction in the gingival volume of the edentulous site due to 
      bone atrophy. This reduced volume must be treated and resolved to obtain a
      satisfactory esthetic result, which is an essential factor for successful implant
      rehabilitation. The classic approach to this problem relies on bone augmentation 
      procedures. However, the present clinical study is aimed at showing that
      insufficient gingival volume may be corrected simply by resorting to soft tissue 
      augmentation, provided that sufficient bone is present to allow implant
      placement. Clinical Considerations: The treatment is described of three cases
      characterized by considerable ridge atrophy that was caused by a simple
      extraction in the first case, periodontal breakdown in the second case, and
      radicular cyst removal in the third case. After healing, all cases presented with
      sufficient bone to allow implant placement, and insufficient volume was treated
      via soft tissue grafts during implant surgery. Esthetic results and patient
      satisfaction were monitored for 2 to 4 years and were very encouraging.
      CONCLUSION: Although the approach described in this report requires further
      investigation, it will likely lead to good results when used to treat a lack of
      pink volume in the most important esthetic area.

PG  - 299-305
LID - 10.1016/j.sdentj.2018.05.010 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To investigate the current considerations in the fabrication of dental
      implant prostheses (DIP) and the state of prosthetic complications from the
      dental technicians (DT) perspective. Methods: A self-designed pretested
      questionnaire and an informed consent were distributed to 150 certified DT
      working in dental laboratories of Riyadh, KSA. The demographic data, questions
      related to the implant fixed/removable prostheses and questions on the prosthetic
      complications related to the DIP were collected. Descriptive statistics and
      Chi-square test were used for statistical analysis, considering a P-value of
      <0.05 using SPSS. Results: 130 responses (response rate 83.6%) were received. 53%
      (n=69) of the DT received job orders for DIP from >20 dentists. 49% (n=64) of
      dentists took the leading role in the treatment planning/designing. 48% (n=62)
      and 52% (n=68) of requests were for Cement and Screw retained DIP respectively.
      Custom abutments 37% (n=49) choice of abutments. Porcelain fused to metal (PFM)
      34% (n=44) and PFM with metal occlusal surface 55% (n=71) were material of
      choice. 49% (n=64) designing of implant overdentures were according to the
      dentist's instructions with Ball and Socket 48% (n=63) to be the most common
      attachment. DT regarded poor implant location/orientation 38% (n=49) and
      inaccuracies in impression/bite-registration 40% (n=52) as the obstacles to
      success. Half 50% (n=65) of the repairs were for facing damage/chipping of
      ceramic. Fracture of the denture base/tooth detachment 50% (n=65) was common with
      implant over dentures. Conclusions: DT played a role and took decisions regarding
      the DIP. Frequent problems found by DT were poor implant location, discrepancies 
      in impression/bite-registration, facing damage/chipping and damage/fracture of
      the denture base/prosthetic teeth. The frequency of these complications can be
      minimized by an increase in the prosthetic knowledge of the dentists and
      establishing clear protocols for communication between the dentist and the DT.

TI  - Uncemented, curved, short endoprosthesis stem for distal femoral reconstruction: 
      early follow-up outcomes.
PG  - 183
LID - 10.1186/s12957-018-1486-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncemented endoprosthetic knee replacement has become a mainstream
      treatment for malignant tumours of the distal femur. Most femoral stems, however,
      are straight and therefore poorly fit the anteriorly bowed curvature of the
      femur. To address this issue, we used a short, curved, uncemented press-fit
      femoral stem and evaluated its short-term outcomes after reconstruction of the
      distal femur. METHODS: Forty-two patients underwent distal femur replacement
      using curved press-fit stem. To assess the interface, we measured the axial
      length of the press-fit area and the perpendicular distance of the radiolucent
      area between the stem and bone on digital images obtained using tomosynthesis
      with Shimadzu Metal Artefact Reduction Technology (T-SMART). Postoperative
      complications and oncological outcomes were monitored at each follow-up visit.
      RESULTS: Of the 42 patients enrolled in the study, two had cancer-related deaths 
      and one had local tumour recurrence. The minimum follow-up time of the surviving 
      patients was 24 months, with no incidence of aseptic loosening or mechanical
      failure of the prosthesis. The average effective contact length between the
      press-fit stem and bone was 74.0 mm, with nearly undetectable radiolucent gaps
      between the implant and the bone on medial-lateral and anteroposterior views.
      CONCLUSIONS: Over the short term, uncemented, curved, short stem provides a
      stable bone-prosthesis interface without any aseptic loosening.

TI  - Two Different Strategies to Enhance Osseointegration in Porous Titanium:
      Inorganic Thermo-Chemical Treatment Versus Organic Coating by Peptide Adsorption.
LID - E2574 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms19092574 [doi]
AB  - In this study, highly-interconnected porous titanium implants were produced by
      powder sintering with different porous diameters and open interconnectivity. The 
      actual foams were produced using high cost technologies: Chemical Vapor
      Deposition (CVD), Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD), and spark plasma sintering,
      and the porosity and/or interconnection was not optimized. The aim was to
      generate a bioactive surface on foams using two different strategies, based on
      inorganic thermo-chemical treatment and organic coating by peptide adsorption, to
      enhance osseointegration. Porosity was produced using NaCl as a space holder and 
      polyethyleneglicol as a binder phase. Static and fatigue tests were performed in 
      order to determine mechanical behaviors. Surface bioactivation was performed
      using a thermo-chemical treatment or by chemical adsorption with peptides.
      Osteoblast-like cells were cultured and cytotoxicity was measured. Bioactivated
      scaffolds and a control were implanted in the tibiae of rabbits.
      Histomorphometric evaluation was performed at 4 weeks after implantation.
      Interconnected porosity was 53% with an average diameter of 210 microm and an
      elastic modulus of around 1 GPa with good mechanical properties. The samples
      presented cell survival values close to 100% of viability. Newly formed bone was 
      observed inside macropores, through interconnected porosity, and on the implant
      surface. Successful bone colonization of inner structure (40%) suggested good
      osteoconductive capability of the implant. Bioactivated foams showed better
      results than non-treated ones, suggesting both bioactivation strategies induce
      osteointegration capability.

TI  - Cervical stabilization with polyaxial pedicle screw and rod construct in horses: 
      A proof of concept study.
PG  - 932-941
LID - 10.1111/vsu.12938 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of a novel technique for cervical
      stabilization. STUDY DESIGN: In vivo experimental. ANIMALS: Four normal adult
      quarterhorse crossbreed horses (2-4 years of age, > 250 kg). METHODS: One
      mid-cervical spinal unit (C3-C4) was distracted with a porous metal interbody
      fusion device (IFD) and stabilized with a polyaxial pedicle screw and rod
      construct. Neurologic examinations were performed preoperatively and
      postoperatively. Radiographs of the fusion site and adjoining vertebrae were
      obtained preoperatively and monthly. Horses were euthanized at 8 months and
      spinal units were evaluated for osseointegration and implant safety via
      micro-computed tomography (CT), histology, and histomorphometry. RESULTS: The
      procedure was performed safely in all horses, without severe postoperative
      complications. Evaluation of radiographs revealed no implant failure, implant
      migration, or spinal unit instability in any of the horses. The presence of new
      bone formation around the screw and rod constructs was confirmed via micro-CT. No
      evidence of inflammation or iatrogenic damage was noted from histology. New bone 
      was present within the IFD in all horses, with variable osseointegration on the
      cranial and caudal surfaces of the implant in 3 horses. CONCLUSION: The novel
      technique reported in the present study was safely applied to stabilize the C3-C4
      spinal unit in the horses tested here and led to variable osseointegration within

TI  - Evaluation of Effect of Low-Dose Methotrexate on Osseointegration of Implants: A 
      Biomechanical Study on Dogs.
PG  - 546-554
LID - 10.2174/1874210601812010546 [doi]
AB  - Background: Methotrexate (MTX) is an immunosuppressive drug, widely used in
      inflammatory disturbances including rheumatoid arthritis. However, there is no
      consensus regarding the effect of MTX on implant osseointegration. Objective: The
      purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the effect of low dose MTX 
      on Bone-Implant Contact (BIC) of dogs. Methods: Six mandibular premolar teeth
      (bilateral) of 8 mature dogs were extracted. After 3 months of healing, 6
      implants (bone level, resorbable blast media surface) were inserted into the
      mandible of each dog (3 in each side). Dogs were randomly divided into a study
      group (receiving 2.5 mg/week MTX orally, 3 times per week for 4 weeks) and a
      control group each containing 4 dogs. In the 1(st) week, postoperative BIC was
      evaluated in 4 dogs, two from each group. In the 4(th) week, reverse torque and
      BIC were evaluated in the remaining 4 dogs. Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA
      test for 95% confidence interval. Results: The reverse torque test of the 4(th)
      week, showed a satisfying osseointegration. Histopathologic evaluation revealed
      that the BIC was significantly higher in the control group in comparison to the
      MTX group in the 1(st) and 4(th) week. In addition, the BIC of both groups were
      significantly increased in the 4(th) week in comparison to the 1(st) week in both
      groups. Conclusion: MTX has the potential to interfere with osseointegration
      process.

      biofilm formation.
PG  - e0202262
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0202262 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Micro- or nano-topography can both provide antimicrobial properties
      and improve osseointegration of dental implant titanium surfaces. Laser treatment
      is one of the best surface microtexturing techniques. The aim of this study was
      to evaluate in vitro and in situ biofilm formation on a laser-treated titanium
      surface, comparing it with two conventional surfaces, machined and grit-blasted. 
      METHODS: For the in vitro experiment, an oral microcosm biofilm model was
      developed on the surface of titanium disks and reference human enamel using a
      bioreactor for 48 h. For the in situ experiment, titanium implants with
      laser-treated, machined and grit-blasted surfaces were mounted on intraoral trays
      and worn by ten volunteers for 48 h. Biofilm formation was quantitatively
      evaluated, and surfaces were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy,
      scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. RESULTS-IN
      VITRO STUDY: Biofilm structures with a prevalence of viable cells covered most of
      the machined, grit-blasted and human enamel surfaces, whereas less dense biofilm 
      structures with non-confluent microcolonies were observed on the laser-treated
      titanium. Laser-treated titanium showed the lowest biofilm formation, where
      microorganisms colonized the edges of the laser-created pits, with very few or no
      biofilm formation observed inside the pits. RESULTS-IN SITU STUDY: The biofilm
      formation pattern observed was similar to that in the in vitro experiment.
      Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed complete coverage of the implant
      threads, with mostly viable cells in grit-blasted and machined specimens.
      Unexpectedly, laser-treated specimens showed few dead microbial cells colonizing 
      the bottom of the threads, while an intense colonization was found on the
      threading sides. CONCLUSION: This data suggests that laser-created
      microtopography can reduce biofilm formation, with a maximum effect when the
      surface is blasted orthogonally by the laser beam. In this sense the orientation 
      of the laser beam seems to be relevant for the biological interaction with
      biofilms.

TI  - Multifunctional effects of a modification of SLA titanium implant surface with
      strontium-containing nanostructures on immunoinflammatory and osteogenic cell
      function.
PG  - 3009-3020
LID - 10.1002/jbm.a.36490 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the effects of surface modification of clinically
      available sandblasted/acid-etched (SLA) titanium oral implants with strontium
      (Sr)-containing nanostructures on both early immunoinflammatory macrophage cell
      functions and osteogenic stem cell functions. The goal was to provide insight for
      future surface engineering of titanium implants with multifunctional effects,
      that is, tissue healing capacity at both the nonosteogenic cell centered initial 
      stage and the subsequent osteogenic cell-governed later stage-osseointegration
      process. The Sr-containing nanostructure was prepared in on the SLA-type implant 
      surface by wet chemical treatment. The results showed that Sr modification is
      favorable for early macrophage cell functions and increases osteogenic capacity
      of the SLA surface. Surface Sr modification notably upregulated regenerative
      macrophage phenotype expression and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 production
      while suppressing inflammatory cytokine TNFalpha. Sr incorporation enhanced
      certain early cellular events of ST2 stem cells such as early cellular spreading 
      and critical integrin gene expression, which in turn notably increased osteogenic
      differentiation (osteogenesis-related phenotype gene expression and osteocalcin
      production) when combined with the microstructured SLA implant surface. Surface
      modification of SLA-type implants with Sr-containing nanostructures demonstrated 
      the ability to favorably influence early immunoinflammatory macrophage cell
      functions and the functionality of osteogenesis cells, resulting in an enhanced
      osseointegration outcome. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res

PG  - 154-157
LID - 10.1016/j.jobcr.2016.10.002 [doi]
AB  - Background: Dental conditions like periodontal, periapical pathologies and failed
      endodontically treated teeth are one of the commonest reasons for tooth removal. 
      These conditions also contraindicate replacement of such teeth with immediate
      implant procedures. Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and
      radiological fate of immediately placed dental implants in debrided infected
      dentoalveolar sockets. Materials and methods: A total of 24 implants were
      immediately placed into prepared infected sockets. The pathology at the
      receptacle sockets included subacute periodontal infection, perio-endo infection,
      chronic periapical infection, periodontal cyst and traumatic infected teeth. The 
      treatment protocol emphasized on meticulous debridement of the infected sockets
      under pre- and post-surgical antibiotic therapy. Follow up of at least 24 months 
      was done to evaluate the survival of implants. Results: At the end of follow up
      time period of 24 months, all 24 implants were stable with no signs of clinical
      mobility and infection. However, on radiological examination, crestal bone loss
      was observed during the osseointegration periods which settled at the level of
      first thread. Conclusion: Survival of immediately placed implants in infected
      sockets is predictable and depends on the meticulous debridement of dentoalveolar
      sockets along with adequate pre- and post-operative antibiotic coverage.

TI  - State of Osseointegrated Titanium Implant Surfaces in Topographical Aspect.
PG  - 8016-8028
LID - 10.1166/jnn.2018.16381 [doi]
AB  - Titanium is a primary metallic biomaterial widely used in dental implants because
      of its favorable mechanical properties and osseointegration capability.
      Currently, increasing interests have been taken in the interaction between
      titanium implant surface and surrounding bone tissue, particularly in surface
      topographical aspect. There are currently several techniques developed to modify 
      surface topographies in the world market of dental implant. In this review, state
      of titanium implant surfaces in topographical aspect is presented from relatively
      smooth surfaces to rougher ones with microtopographies and/or nanotopographies.
      Each surface is summarized with basic elaborations, preparation methods,
      mechanisms for cellular responses and current availabilities. It has been
      demonstrated that rough surfaces evolving from micro- to nano-scale, especially
      hierarchical micro-and nanotopographies, are favorable for faster and stronger
      osseointegration. Further experimental and clinical investigations will aid in
      the optimization of surface topography and clinical selection of suitable
      implants.

TI  - Oral Implantology: Myths Exposed in Recent Research.
PG  - 6-10; quiz 11
AB  - Today, a variety of surgical and prosthetic protocols, implant designs, and
      prosthetic devices are used for implant dentistry, employing many different
      dental technologies. With a plethora of options available, choosing an implant
      system has become highly challenging for practitioners. Having an understanding
      of the role of different implant design properties may help clinicians make
      informed decisions. This article provides an overview of factors affecting
      osseointegration and preservation of bone and discusses the importance of
      surgical and prosthetic treatments that respect the biologic width and avoid
      interventions, such as cementation, that may disturb the surrounding soft and
      hard tissues.

TI  - Immediate implant placement following 1-year treatment with oral versus
      intravenous bisphosphonates: a histomorphometric canine study on peri-implant
      bone.
PG  - 1803-1809
LID - 10.1007/s00784-018-2579-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bisphosphonates (BPs) are anti-resorptive medications with inhibitory
      effects on osteoclasts which decrease bone turnover. The present study aimed to
      assess the early effects of BPs on peri-implant bone. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Twelve female mongrel dogs were assigned to one control and two experimental
      groups as follows: 12 months of oral alendronate (ALN, 3.5 mg/kg/week) or
      intravenous (IV) pamidronate (PAM, 1 mg/kg/week) for experimental groups.
      Following 8 weeks after implant insertion, the specimens were sacrificed,
      histological evaluation was performed, and C-terminal telopeptide of collagen I
      (CTx) analysis was performed on serums. RESULTS: PAM demonstrated the greatest
      marginal bone level (MBL), 2.64 +/- 0.48, followed by ALN and control, 2.5 +/-
      0.4 and 0.66 +/- 0.5 respectively. The least bone-implant contact was observed in
      PAM group (%39 +/- 0.03) while it was significantly greater in the control group 
      (p < 0.05). PAM and ALN demonstrated < 10 CTx levels versus > 300 in controls.
      CONCLUSION: It is assumed that long-term oral or IV BP therapy decreases marginal
      bone resorption and osseointegration. These changes were more accentuated in IV
      BP administration. CTx does not seem to be a precise predictor for
      bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: BPs impair
      peri-implant bone remodeling and this phenomena may be effective for reducing
      resorption at esthetic zone implants; however, decrease in osseointegration may
      be a concern for implant treatment in patients receiving BPs.

TI  - Evaluation of retroauricular skin mobility for bone-anchored solutions.
PG  - 802-806
LID - 10.1017/S0022215118001512 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A subset of patients with bone-anchored hearing aids develop skin
      reactions that may be related to excess skin mobility around the skin-penetrating
      abutments. However, there is a lack of reports on the extent of skin mobility
      within the retroauricular space, typical for the implant location. METHODS: This 
      study was based on photographic analysis of the relative shifts between the skull
      and soft tissue of the head in the retroauricular region, detected under the
      physiological conditions of head support and facial muscle contraction. RESULTS: 
      The mean calculated value for skin shifts at the implant site was 5.1 mm. In 84
      per cent of cases, the extent of skin shift was greater with the head at rest, by
      an average of 3.1 mm. The extent of skin movement during facial muscle
      contraction ranged between 0 mm and 8.9 mm. No direct correlations were detected 
      between the extent and direction of skin shifts and patients' age, gender or body
      mass index. CONCLUSION: There are no objective data that can predict individual
      skin movement at the osseointegrated implant site. The study confirmed high
      variability in terms of the direction and extent of skin shift, which should be
      discussed when managing related skin problems.

TI  - Insertion Torque of Variable-Thread Tapered Implants in the Posterior Maxilla: A 
      Clinical Study.
PG  - e788-e794
LID - 10.1111/jopr.12965 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Primary stability is a key factor for successful implant
      osseointegration, especially in poor bone quality and early/immediate loading. In
      the immediate loading protocol, insertion torque values (ITVs) have been
      suggested to be the most valid prognostic factor for osseointegration of
      maxillary implants. The objectives of this study were to: (1) evaluate ITVs
      achieved by a variable-thread tapered implant in the posterior maxilla; and (2)
      assess the impact of bone quality, implant dimensions, bicortical anchorage, and 
      implant location on ITVs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six adult, systemically
      healthy patients received 173 variable-thread tapered implants in maxillary
      premolar and molar healed edentulous sites with a minimum subsinus height of 8
      mm. Implant sites were prepared using the bone-quality adjusted drilling sequence
      according to manufacturer's recommendations. Bone quality was recorded
      subjectively during drilling based on Misch criteria (D1-D4), and ITVs were
      measured with a manual torque wrench. Univariate and multivariate analyses were
      performed at the 0.05 significance level. RESULTS: First and second molar sites
      accounted for 46.8% of all implants. D4 bone was encountered in 61.3% of the
      sites. Most of the implants were 4.3 mm in diameter (59.5%), and lengths of 11.5 
      and 13 mm were most commonly used (75.2%). Approximately half of the implants
      were associated with apical cortical anchorage (51.4%). The overall mean ITV was 
      44.5 +/- 23.0 Ncm, with 65.5 +/- 15.6 Ncm, 55.5 +/- 19.6 Ncm, and 36.6 +/- 21.7
      Ncm for D2, D3, and D4 bone, respectively. Bone quality and implant location
      significantly affected ITVs, while implant dimensions and apical cortical
      anchorage did not. CONCLUSIONS: ITVs of variable-thread implants were
      significantly influenced by variations in bone quality and implant position in
      the posterior maxilla. Despite the influence of bone quality on primary
      stability, the mean ITVs attained with variable-thread tapered implants in poor
      bone quality were within the recommended range for immediate loading.

TI  - Implant-Retained Overdenture for a Patient With Severe Lichen Planus: A Case
      Report With 3 Years' Follow-Up and a Systematic Review.
PG  - 59-69
LID - S0278-2391(18)30852-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.joms.2018.07.031 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe a new case using
      implant-retained overdentures in a patient with severe oral lichen planus (OLP)
      and to perform a literature review to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      implant rehabilitation in OLP patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our patient with
      erosive OLP, restoration was performed with implant-retained overdentures using
      the Locator attachment system (Zest Anchors, Escondido, CA). Our case showed
      favorable restorative results and excellent implant osseointegration with
      acceptable marginal bone resorption during the follow-up period of 3 years. We
      performed a literature search of the PubMed (Medline), Embase, and Cochrane
      databases for articles published between 1990 and 2018 using the key terms "oral 
      lichen planus" and "implant." RESULTS: This search identified 13 publications,
      including 9 single case reports or case series and 4 small-scale controlled
      studies. A total of 86 OLP patients and 259 dental implants were analyzed. The
      survival rate of implants was 95.8% during a follow-up period ranging from 1 to
      13 years. CONCLUSION: Dental implants seem to be an acceptable and reliable
      treatment option in patients with OLP. Nevertheless, clinical information on this
      topic is still scarce, and more well-designed randomized studies are needed to
      define the benefits and risks of implant rehabilitation in OLP patients.

TI  - Effect of Different Morphology of Titanium Surface on the Bone Healing in Defects
      Filled Only with Blood Clot: A New Animal Study Design.
PG  - 4265474
LID - 10.1155/2018/4265474 [doi]
AB  - Background: The objective of the present histologic animal study was to analyze
      whether roughness of the titanium surface can influence and/or stimulate the bone
      growth in defects filled with the blood using a rabbit tibia model. Materials and
      Methods: Forty sets (implant and abutment), dental implant (3.5 mm in diameter
      and 7 mm in length) plus healing abutment (2.5 mm in diameter), were inserted in 
      the tibiae of 10 rabbits. Moreover, twenty titanium discs were prepared. The
      abutment and discs were treated by 4 different methods and divided into 4 groups:
      (group A) machined abutments (smooth); (group B) double acid etching treatment;
      (group C) treatment with blasting with particles of aluminum oxide blasted plus
      acid conditioning; (group D) treatment with thorough blasting with particles of
      titanium oxide plus acid conditioning. The discs were used to characterize the
      surfaces by a profilometer and scanning electronic microscopy. Results: After 8
      weeks, the new bone formation around the sets of the samples was analyzed
      qualitatively and quantitatively in relation to bone height from the base of the 
      implant and presence of osteocytes. Group C (1.50+/-0.20 mm) and group D
      (1.62+/-0.18 mm) showed bone growth on the abutment with higher values compared
      to group A (0.94+/-0.30 mm) and group B (1.19+/-0.23 mm), with significant
      difference between the groups (P < 0.05). In addition, osteocyte presence was
      higher in groups with surface treatment related to machined (P < 0.05).
      Conclusions: Within the limitations of the present study, it was possible to
      observe that there is a direct relationship between the roughness present on the 
      titanium surface and the stimulus for bone formation, since the presence of
      larger amounts of osteocytes on SLA surfaces evidenced this fact. Furthermore,
      the increased formation of bone tissue in height demonstrates that there is an
      important difference between the physical and chemical methods used for surface
      treatment.

TI  - Implant-associated gene expression in the jaw bone of smokers and nonsmokers: A
      human study using quantitative qPCR.
PG  - 937-953
LID - 10.1111/clr.13351 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the molecular events in implant-adherent 
      cells and in peri-implant bone during the osseointegration of machined and
      oxidized titanium implants in smokers and nonsmokers. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Twenty-four smokers and 24 nonsmokers each received machined and anodically
      oxidized mini-implants. The mini-implants and the surrounding bone were retrieved
      after 1, 7, and 28 days, for gene expression analysis of selected factors using
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: Differences between
      machined and oxidized implants were more evident in the implant-adherent cells
      than the peri-implant bone. The machined implants revealed higher expression of
      proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-8 (IL-8) (in nonsmokers), and tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha (in nonsmokers and smokers), compared with the oxidized
      implants. Conversely, the expression of bone formation genes, alkaline
      phosphatase and osteocalcin, was generally higher at the oxidized implants. In
      smokers, the temporal pattern revealed the delayed and initial inhibition of
      osteoblastic and osteoclastic gene expression, respectively, mainly at the
      machined implants. In contrast, oxidized implants revealed higher expression of
      bone remodeling, cathepsin K (CatK) and calcitonin receptor, and coupling,
      receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin, 
      genes after 7 day in smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The implant-adherent cells are more
      sensitive to surface properties and smoking conditions than the cells in the
      peri-implant bone. Smoking imposes inhibitory effects on the initial molecular
      events of osseointegration in the human bone-implant interface. The surface
      properties of oxidized implants appear to have a beneficial effect on
      osseointegration by mitigating the smoking-induced negative effects.

TI  - Sustained Release of Zoledronic Acid from Mesoporous TiO(2)-Layered Implant
      Enhances Implant Osseointegration in Osteoporotic Condition.
PG  - 1965-1978
LID - 10.1166/jbn.2018.2635 [doi]
AB  - Implant surface modification that provides local sustained release of
      osteoinductive therapeutic agents enhances implant stability. We designed a
      mesoporous TiO2-layered titanium implant (MLT) by modified anodization technique 
      that allowed local sustained release of zoledronic acid up to 21 days. Mesoporous
      layer has pore size 15 nm, depth approximately 30 mum, volume 0.32 cm3/g, surface
      area 112.3 m2/g, surface roughness 20 nm and water contact angle 18.3 degrees .
      Zoledronic acid-loaded MLT (MLT-Z) was biocompatible, showed anabolic effect on
      bone forming osteoblasts and catabolic effect on bone resorbing osteoclasts. MLT 
      or MLT-Z implants were implanted in osteoporotic rat-tail vertebrae. Smooth
      implant in healthy rats were used as a positive control. Histomorphometric
      analysis showed that bone implant contact of smooth implant in osteoporotic rats 
      was reduced by 4.1-fold compared to healthy rats and MLT-Z rescued the effect by 
      53%. Similar effect was observed in implant fixation, mechanical stability, BV/TV
      ratio, Tb.N, Tb.Th and OI% among the groups. Histological and mu-CT images
      strongly supported the above-mentioned findings. In conclusion, a novel
      surface-fabricated MLT-Z gives local sustained drug release, robustly enhances
      implant osseointegration and stability in osteoporotic condition, suggesting it
      as a promising implant model for patients with compromised bone quality.

TI  - Evaluation of bone turnover after bisphosphonate withdrawal and its influence on 
      implant osseointegration: an in vivo study in rats.
PG  - 1733-1744
LID - 10.1007/s00784-018-2612-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate bone turnover alterations
      after alendronate (ALD) withdrawal and its influence on dental implants
      osseointegration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy female Wistar rats were randomly
      divided in 2 groups that received on day 0 either placebo (control group-CTL; n =
      10) or 1 mg/kg sodium alendronate (ALD; n = 60) once a week for 4 months. At day 
      120, ALD treatment was suspended for 50 animals. Then, a titanium implant was
      placed in the left tibia of each rat that were randomly allocated in five
      subgroups of ten animals each, according to the period of evaluation: day 0
      (INT-0), day 7 (INT-7), day 14 (INT-14), day 28 (INT-28), and day 45 (INT-45)
      after ALD withdrawal. CTL group and a group that received ALD until the end of
      the experimental period (non-interrupted group-non-INT; n = 10) underwent implant
      placement on day 120. Animals were euthanized 28 days after implant surgery. Bone
      mineral density (BMD) of femur and lumbar vertebrae were evaluated by DXA,
      biochemical markers of bone turnover were analyzed by ELISA, and bone
      histomorphometry was performed to measure bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone 
      area fraction occupancy (BAFO). RESULTS: All groups receiving ALD showed higher
      BMD values when compared to CTL group, which were maintained after its
      withdrawal. Decreased concentrations in all bone turnover markers were observed
      in the non-INT group, and in the groups in which ALD was discontinued compared to
      the CTL group. The non-INT group showed lower %BIC and notably changes in bone
      quality, which was persistent after drug withdrawal. CONCLUSION: Collectively,
      the findings of this study demonstrated that ALD therapy decreased bone turnover 
      and impaired bone quality and quantity around dental implants, and that its
      discontinuation did not reverse these findings. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The severe
      suppression of bone turnover caused by the prolonged use of ALD may alter the
      capacity of bone tissue to integrate with the implant threads impairing the
      osseointegration process.

TI  - Effect of Laser Therapy on the Osseointegration of Immediately Loaded Dental
      Implants in Patients under Vitamin C, Omega-3 and Calcium Therapy.
PG  - 1468-1474
LID - 10.3889/oamjms.2018.291 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of laser therapy in the biostimulation of bone repair has
      been growing steadily. AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the radio-densitometric 
      effect of low-intensity laser therapy on the osseointegration of immediately
      loaded dental implants in patients under vitamin C, omega-3 and calcium therapy. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single implant was placed in the mandibular first molar
      region of twenty patients which were equally divided into two groups. In the
      non-laser group, the healing phase was left to progress spontaneously without any
      intervention, while in the laser group it was augmented with low-level laser
      therapy of wavelength 904 nm in contact mode, continuous wave, 20 mW output power
      and exposure time 30 sec with a dose 4.7 J/cm(2). Patients in both groups were
      given vitamin C, calcium and omega-3 starting one month preoperatively.
      Postoperative digital panoramas were taken immediately after surgery, 1.5 months 
      and 6 months postoperatively. Changes in bone density along the bone-implant
      interface at the mesial, distal and apical sides were assessed using the Digora
      software. RESULTS: Independent student t-test was used to compare means of
      variables between the laser and the non-laser group while repeated measures ANOVA
      was used to compare bone densities at different times for the same group.
      Significant increased differences were observed at the mesial, distal and apical 
      sides surrounding the implants of both groups per time. However, the rate of
      increase was significantly higher in the laser group. The mean difference at the 
      mesial side after 6 months was 21.99 +/- 5.48 in the laser group and 14.21 +/-
      4.95 in the non-laser group, while it read 21.74 +/- 3.56 in the laser group and 
      10.78 +/- 3.90 in non-laser group at the distal side and was 18.90 +/- 5.91 in
      the laser group and 10.39 +/- 3.49 in non-laser group at the apical side.
      Significance was recorded at P = 0.004, P = 0.0001, and 0.001 at the mesial,
      distal and apical sides respectively. CONCLUSION: The low-intensity laser
      irradiation significantly promoted bone healing and speeded up the
      osseointegration process emphasising the laser's biostimulatory effect.

TI  - Healing at sites prepared using different drilling protocols. An experimental
      study in the tibiae of sheep.
PG  - e0202957
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0202957 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the experiment was to study the healing at implants installed in site 
      prepared in bone type 1 using different rotation speeds and cooling strategies.
      The tibiae of twelve sheep were used as experimental sites. Two implant sites
      were prepared in each tibia using drills either at a high or a mixed speed under 
      irrigation. At the mixed-speed sites, 60 rpm without irrigation were applied for 
      the last drill, the countersink and during implant installation. Biopsies
      representing the healing after 1, 2, and 6 weeks were obtained and ground
      sections were prepared. At the histological analyses, after 1 week of healing, no
      new bone was found at both high- and mixed-speed sites. After 2 weeks of healing,
      small amounts of newly formed bone were observed in the cortical layer, reaching 
      percentages of 3.6+/-3.0% at the mixed-speed sites, and of 2.2+/-1.5% at the
      high-speed sites. An irrelevant quantity of new bone was seen in the marrow
      compartments of a few specimens. After 6 weeks of healing, new bone was found in 
      higher quantity, reaching in the cortical compartment 66.9+/-6.8% and
      67.3+/-17.7% at the mixed- and high-speed sites, respectively. The respective
      percentages in the marrow compartment were 23.2+/-13.0% and 30.6+/-29.2%. No
      statistically significant differences between high- and mixed-speed groups were
      found. It was concluded that the use of the last drill and the installation of
      the implant with or without irrigation yielded similar bone healing and
      osseointegration.

TI  - Clinical outcome of removable prostheses supported by mini dental implants. A
      systematic review.
PG  - 628-637
LID - 10.1080/00016357.2018.1499958 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: For many years, edentulous patients have had no other option than
      conventional dentures to reestablish their oral function. To avoid the need for
      bone graft surgery, some professionals have suggested the use of mini dental
      implants (MDIs) to support prostheses. The MDIs are narrow implants, ranging
      approximately from 1.8 to 2.9 mm in diameter. Recently, the promising results of 
      mini implants regarding osseointegration and patient satisfaction have led
      clinicians to accept them as a definitive treatment option. OBJECTIVE: Therefore,
      the proposition of this systematic review was to assess information on the
      outcomes of MDIs supporting removable prostheses. METHODS: The PubMed and
      Cochrane databases were searched for articles published before September 2017,
      which yielded a total of 774 studies for analysis. After exclusion and inclusion 
      criteria, 22 prospective studies were included in this systematic review.
      RESULTS: Most mini implants were placed in a flapless single-stage surgery and
      loaded immediately. Most studies reported failures in the first year and
      prosthetic complications. The mean survival rate of the selected studies was
      95.6%, and mean follow-up was 22.8 months. CONCLUSION: The MDI-supported
      removable prostheses successfully improved patients' chewing and speaking
      ability, quality of life, and satisfaction, suggesting that MDIs are a viable and
      safe option to support removable prostheses in the mandibular arch.

TI  - The synergistic effect of strontium-substituted hydroxyapatite and microRNA-21 on
      improving bone remodeling and osseointegration.

LID - 10.1039/c8bm00716k [doi]
AB  - Surgical failure, mainly caused by loosening implants, causes great mental and
      physical trauma to patients. As the population ages, improving the
      physicochemical properties of implants to achieve favourable osseointegration
      will continue to be the focus of future research. Herein, we fabricated a
      titanium (Ti)-based SrHA/miR-21 composite coating that was generated by
      hydrothermal deposition of SrHA followed by miR-21 nanocapsule immobilisation.
      Both SrHA nanoparticles with good superhydrophilicity and miR-21 nanocapsules
      with uniform sizes were distributed evenly on the surface of Ti. In vitro
      experiments revealed that the composite coating was beneficial for osteoblast
      proliferation, differentiation and mineralization. In vivo evaluations
      demonstrated that this coating could not only promote the expression of the
      angiogenic factor CD31 but also enhance the expression of osteoblastic genes to
      facilitate angio-osteogenesis. In addition, the composite coating also showed a
      decreased RANKL expression compared with the miR-21 coating. As a result, the
      SrHA/miR-21 composite coating promoted new bone formation and mineralization and 
      thus enhanced osseointegration and bone-implant bonding strength. Therefore, this
      method provides a new strategy for bone repair.

TI  - The effect of low-magnitude high-frequency loading on peri-implant bone healing
      and implant osseointegration in Beagle dogs.

AB  - PURPOSE: Low-magnitude, high-frequency (LMHF) loading plays an important role in 
      bone healing. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of LMHF loading
      applied directly to titanium dental implants on peri-implant bone healing and
      implant osseointegration. METHODS: The mandibular premolars and molars were
      extracted from six male Beagle dogs. Three months post-extraction, each of the
      six dogs had three titanium implants (Aadva Standard Implant Narrow, Phi3.3x8mm) 
      inserted into the mandibular premolar and molar area (three implants per side).
      In each animal, one side was randomly selected to undergo daily LMHF loading
      (treatment group), while the other side had no further intervention (control).
      The loading was applied directly to the implant abutment using an individual jig 
      and a custom-made loading device (8mum, 100Hz). The implant stability quotient
      (ISQ) was tested every week. Three dogs were euthanized after 2 weeks, and three 
      were euthanized after 8 weeks. Tissue samples were fixed and stained for
      micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histomorphometric analyses. Data were
      analyzed statistically, with significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS: The treatment
      group had significantly increased peri-implant bone volume relative to tissue
      volume in region of interest 2 (100-500mum) compared with the control group after
      2 weeks of loading (p<0.05); however, there was no significant difference between
      groups after 8 weeks. The ISQ value and the micro-CT results did not differ
      between groups during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: LMHF loading positively
      influenced peri-implant bone healing in the early healing period.

TI  - Enhanced Osseointegration of Hierarchically Structured Ti Implant with
      Electrically Bioactive SnO2-TiO2 Bilayered Surface.
PG  - 30191-30200
LID - 10.1021/acsami.8b10928 [doi]
AB  - The poor osseointegration of Ti implant significantly compromise its application 
      in load-bearing bone repair and replacement. Electrically bioactive coating
      inspirited from heterojunction on Ti implant can benefit osseointegration but
      cannot avoid the stress shielding effect between bone and implant. To resolve
      this conflict, hierarchically structured Ti implant with electrically bioactive
      SnO2-TiO2 bilayered surface has been developed to enhance osseointegration.
      Benefiting from the electric cue offered by the built-in electrical field of
      SnO2-TiO2 heterojunction and the topographic cue provided by the hierarchical
      surface structure to bone regeneration, the osteoblastic function of basic
      multicellular units around the implant is significantly improved. Because the
      individual TiO2 or SnO2 coating with uniform surface exhibits no electrical
      bioactivity, the effects of electric and topographic cues to osseointegration
      have been decoupled via the analysis of in vivo performance for the placed Ti
      implant with different surfaces. The developed Ti implant shows significantly
      improved osseointegration with excellent bone-implant contact, improved
      mineralization of extracellular matrix, and increased push-out force. These
      results suggest that the synergistic strategy of combing electrical bioactivity
      with hierarchical surface structure provides a new platform for developing
      advanced endosseous implants.

TI  - Orthognathic surgery Deteriorates the osseointegration of dental implants: A
      propensity-matched multicentre cohort study.
PG  - 967-973
LID - 10.1111/joor.12705 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the possible influence of the regional
      acceleratory phenomenon (RAP) on dental implant osseointegration. Orthognathic
      surgery was set as an intervention for RAP, and a multicentre cohort study of two
      groups was undertaken. Group O included patients with single implant placement at
      least 4 months after orthognathic surgery and functional loading for more than 1 
      year, while controls (Group C) were without any major surgery. Clinical and
      radiographic assessments of implants, including changes in marginal bone levels, 
      were analysed at baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-up. Bivariate analysis of two
      groups with propensity score matching was performed. After propensity score
      matching, all 10 confounding variables had acceptable standardised difference
      scores (<20%), indicating that the matching procedure had efficiently balanced
      the two groups. Following the propensity score adjustment, the marginal bone loss
      was significantly higher in Group O than the control at 6 months (1.66 +/- 1.05
      mm vs 0.59 +/- 0.64 mm, P < 0.001) and 12 months (2.30 +/- 1.27 mm vs 0.82 +/-
      0.78 mm, P < 0.001). Compared to Group C, subjects in Group O had a higher
      incidence of peri-implant mucositis and implantitis (11.8% vs 1.5%, P = 0.033).
      Impaired osseointegration of dental implants was associated with orthognathic
      surgery. Special considerations for peri-implant soft and hard tissue stability
      should be addressed to obtain ideal treatment results and prognosis for patients 
      who have had prior orthognathic surgery.

TI  - The effect of low-level laser 810 nm and light-emitting diode photobiomodulation 
      (626 nm) on the stability of the implant and inflammatory markers interleukin-1
      beta and prostaglandin E2, around implants.
PG  - 283-288
AB  - Background: One of the most common problems in edentulous patients is the low
      stability of lower dentures. The most effective method to overcome this problem
      is implant-supported overdentures. After placing an implant, for the process of
      osseointegration to be complete and successful, it is better that patients do not
      use their denture for few months. This may be nonconvenient for patient because
      they are unable to speak and eat properly. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      the effect of low level laser (LLL) and light-emitting diode (LED)
      photobiomodulation on implant stability as well as their effect on interleukin-1 
      beta (IL-1beta) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biomarkers around implant in lower
      anterior region (over denture). Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, 36
      implants were placed in fully edentulous mandibles (12 people per person - three 
      implants in areas of midline and canine). Each of the implants was randomly
      placed in one of three groups of laser, LED, and control. LLL (power of 50 mw and
      the amount of 20 J/cm(2) for each implant) and LED with dose (20 mw/cm(2)) were
      irradiated on the day of surgery (zero), 3, 7, 10, and 14 days. The stability of 
      implants was measured on the day of surgery and weeks 3, 4, and 8 after surgery
      with Periotest. The inflammatory biomarkers of IL-1beta and PGE2 were also
      collected from gingival crevicular fluid around implants in 4 and 8 weeks. The
      collected data were analyzed by ANOVA statistical tests.pvalue<0.05 considered
      significant. Results: The amounts of Periotest significantly increased 3(rd) week
      after surgery in the control group (P < 0.001). However, the laser group and LED 
      group were associated with minimal changes, which indicates lower stability of
      implant in 3(rd) week in control group but no changes in stability of test groups
      (laser and LED). Laser and LED had no effect on the level of IL-1beta and PGE2 in
      4 and 8 weeks. Conclusion: The use of LLL or LED has a positive effect on the
      stability of the implants 3 weeks after surgery.

TI  - Local delivery of a zoledronate solution improves osseointegration of titanium
      implants in a rat distal femur model.
PG  - 3294-3298
LID - 10.1002/jor.24125 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to determine whether locally applied anti-resorptive agents
      acetazolamide or zoledronic acid would improve mechanical stability in implant
      osseointegration when applied as a solution within the medullary canal.
      Thirty-three rats received titanium-implants bilaterally in their intramedullary 
      femoral canals. Prior to implantation, animals received 0.1 ml saline, 1 mM
      acetazolamide solution, or 0.7 mM zoledronic acid solution directly into the
      medullary cavity. The control group only received saline within the medullary
      canal while the treatment groups only received the respective treatment to which 
      they were randomized. Animals were allowed to heal 4 weeks, at which time they
      were euthanized and femurs isolated for mechanical and radiographic evaluation.
      Push-out force to failure increased 152% in the zoledronic acid group relative to
      the control. There was no significant difference in push-out force with
      acetazolamide relative to control. Also, zoledronic acid increased metaphyseal
      bone volume fraction 46% and increased metaphyseal bone-implant contact 58%
      relative to the control. Recent research exploring local injection of medications
      to improve implant osseointegration and minimize systemic-effects has failed to
      quantitatively evaluate implant fixation strength on non-hydroxyapatite coated
      implants or implants without previous bone compaction. This study demonstrated
      that a simple injection of zoledronic acid into the medullary canal, rather than 
      coatings or commercial gels, can increase fixation strength of an uncoated
      titanium-implant. Our findings indicate simple injection of zoledronic acid in
      saline solution has the potential for improving fixation of uncemented joint
      implants. Clinical Significance: Intramedullary injection of local bisphosphonate
      solutions could be implemented to improve osseointegration in cementless
      arthroplasty. (c) 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley

PG  - 2041731418790694

AB  - Titanium (Ti) plays a predominant role as the material of choice in orthopaedic
      and dental implants. Despite the majority of Ti implants having long-term
      success, premature failure due to unsuccessful osseointegration leading to
      aseptic loosening is still too common. Recently, surface topography modification 
      and biological/non-biological coatings have been integrated into
      orthopaedic/dental implants in order to mimic the surrounding biological
      environment as well as reduce the inflammation/infection that may occur. In this 
      review, we summarize the impact of various Ti coatings on cell behaviour both in 
      vivo and in vitro. First, we focus on the Ti surface properties and their effects
      on osteogenesis and then on bacterial adhesion and viability. We conclude from
      the current literature that surface modification of Ti implants can be generated 
      that offer both osteoinductive and antimicrobial properties.

AB  - Immediate implant placement and provisional restoration has become a popular and 
      well-supported method of tooth replacement in the maxillary anterior dentition.
      Aside from achieving osseointegration, esthetic demands have grown with better
      understanding of the behavior of hard and soft tissues following this mode to
      therapy. Stability of gingival contours, texture of the surrounding tissues, and 
      blending of prosthetic components with the natural dentition are critical for
      successful outcomes to be maintained long-term. Increasing soft tissue thickness 
      at the time of therapy plays an important role in this regard. A technique
      combining the proven principles of immediate implant placement and provisional
      restoration with hard and soft tissue augmentation using nonautogenous materials 
      is demonstrated with comparisons to nongrafted, temporized historical controls.

TI  - UK trial of the Osseointegrated Prosthesis for the Rehabilitation for Amputees:
      1995-2018.
PG  - 112-122
LID - 10.1177/0309364618791616 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND:: Amputation of a limb impacts on patients' self-perception and
      quality of life. Prostheses directly anchored to the skeleton are being
      investigated, aiming to avoid soft tissue complications. OBJECTIVES:: We report
      outcome data for the UK trial of the Osseointegrated Prosthesis for the
      Rehabilitation of Amputees Implant System with a minimum of 9-year follow-up.
      METHODS:: Eighteen transfemoral amputees received unilateral implants between
      1997 and 2008. Five were implanted before a formalised protocol, called
      Osseointegrated Prosthesis for the Rehabilitation of Amputees, was developed.
      Mean follow-up of the Pre-Osseointegrated Prosthesis for the Rehabilitation of
      Amputees group is 11.4 years (1.8-18.6 years), while for the Post-Osseointegrated
      Prosthesis for the Rehabilitation of Amputees group it is 12.3 years (2.9-15.9). 
      RESULTS:: The Kaplan-Meier cumulative survivorship is 40% for the
      Pre-Osseointegrated Prosthesis for the Rehabilitation of Amputees group and
      80.21% for the Post-Osseointegrated Prosthesis for the Rehabilitation of Amputees
      group. Five implants (28%) have been removed, three (17%) for deep infection, one
      (5.6%) for chronic pain, later proven to be infected and one (5.6%) due to
      implant fracture secondary to loosening due to infection. Two patients (11%) have
      peri-implant infections suppressed with oral antibiotics. Eleven cases (61%) of
      superficial infection were successfully treated with antibiotics. 36-Item
      short-form health survey and Questionnaire for persons with a Transfemoral
      Amputation showed significant improvements in quality of life up to 5 years after
      implantation. CONCLUSION:: This small cohort of patients demonstrates
      osseointegrated prosthesis allows prolonged usage and improves patients' quality 
      of life compared to conventional prostheses. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These prostheses
      may provide a future gold standard for amputees and this study provides the first
      outcome data over such a time period to be reported from outside of the
      developers group.

AB  - Primary stability in dental implants is an essential factor for achieving
      successful osseointegration. Surgical procedure and bone quality are among the
      most common factors that affect primary stability. It is also crucial to achieve 
      high-insertion torque which is important for obtaining primary stability.
      Maintaining sufficient bone bulk and density is essential to achieve necessary
      bone-to-implant contact for obtaining a biomechanically stable implant. A new
      concept for osteotomy called osseodensification (OD) has been at the forefront of
      changes in surgical site preparation in implantology. This relatively new concept
      with universally compatible drills has been proposed to help in better osteotomy 
      preparation, bone densification, and indirect sinus lift and also achieve bone
      expansion at different sites of varying bone densities. This procedure has also
      shown improvement in achieving better implant primary stability and better
      osteotomy than conventional implant drills. A systematic review was undertaken to
      analyze if OD procedure had any advantages over conventional osteotomy on bone
      density and primary stability. An electronic database search was conducted in
      PubMed using keywords such as "OD," "implant primary stability," "implant bone
      density," and "implant osteotomy." A total of 195 articles were collected and
      subjected to screening using inclusion and exclusion criteria. A literature
      review was done, following which it was seen that the use of versah drills for
      bone OD resulted in undersized osteotomy compared to conventional drills. It also
      resulted in improved bone density and increase in percentage bone volume and
      bone-to-implant contact, thereby improving implant stability.

TI  - Retrospective radiographic observational study of 1692 Straumann tissue-level
      dental implants over 10 years: I. Implant survival and loss pattern.
PG  - 860-866
LID - 10.1111/cid.12659 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implant dentistry is progressing based on extensive scientific
      results including preclinical and clinical studies. Researchers and clinicians
      have focused on implant designs and surface characteristics, which has resulted
      in various features being developed and introduced for enhancing osseointegration
      and reducing complications. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine
      the cumulative survival rates of Straumann tissue-level dental implants over a
      10-year period and identify the patterns of implant loss at a single research
      institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 1692 implants were installed in 881
      patients who visited the Department of Periodontology, Dental Hospital, Yonsei
      University, Seoul from January 2003 to December 2009. Cases in which the implant 
      was completely removed were defined as implant failures. Electronic or paper
      charts and radiographs were used to determine whether the implants failed. The
      survival rate of implants was analyzed using lifetime tables and Kaplan-Meier
      survival estimates. Log-rank test and Cox regression with shared frailty were
      used to analyze the risk factors and the types of implant failure. RESULTS: The
      10-year cumulative survival rates were 98.23% and 95.70% at the implant and
      patient levels, respectively. Before installing a prosthesis (defined as the
      early stage), 13 implants in 10 patients were removed, while eight implants in
      seven patients were removed after completing a prosthesis (defined as the late
      stage). The cumulative survival rate was related to the implant diameter, length,
      site, and insertion torque. Most implant failures within 1 year were attributable
      to osseointegration failure. There were several cases of failure in the late
      stage without apparent marginal bone loss. CONCLUSION: Straumann tissue-level
      dental implants showed low failure rates and can be considered a useful long-term
      treatment option. The length, placement site, and insertion torque might affect
      implant survival.

TI  - Surgical experience, workload and learning curve vs postoperative outcome.
PG  - S167-S178
AB  - AIM: In this review, we look at the factor of the surgical experience and
      surgical workload in a variety of surgical disciplines and its effect on the
      intraoperative and postoperative complications rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An
      extensive systematic electronic search was carried out on the relevant databases.
      Two independent reviewers were engaged in selecting appropriate articles in line 
      with the protocol. RESULTS: It was very interesting to see that only 52 studies
      could be identified as per the inclusion criteria and search keywords. This
      included studies from 1990 onwards, spanning all surgical disciplines. Six
      studies were identified in third molar surgery, one of the most common surgeries 
      practiced across all surgical disciplines. Seven appropriate oral implant surgery
      studies were identified, covering two-stage implants and immediately loaded
      implants. The evidence was overwhelming that the surgeon's experience positively 
      correlates with the level of osseointegration and implant success. An interesting
      study from general surgery highlighted the fact it is not unusual to see senior
      surgeons selected to operate on complex patients or carry out complex surgical
      procedures than their junior colleagues. In face, this may explain why a number
      of studies identified no difference in the surgical complications between seniors
      and juniors. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that experience matters, many factors 
      can influence the outcome of the surgery. If the surgeon, despite his/her lack of
      seniority, manages to utilise experience appropriately then there will be a
      beneficial outcome for the patient.

TI  - CBCT vs other imaging modalities to assess peri-implant bone and diagnose
      complications: a systematic review.
PG  - 77-92
AB  - AIM: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the diagnostic value
      of CBCT compared with 2D imaging and clinical gold standard techniques in
      peri-implant bone defect detection and measurement. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science
      databases up to July 2017. Clinical, ex vivo, in vitro and animal studies that
      assessed and measured peri-implant bone defects using different imaging
      modalities were included in this review. Two reviewers performed data extraction 
      and qualitative analysis. The methodological quality of each study was reviewed
      using the QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS: The initial search revealed 2849 unique papers.
      Full-text analysis was performed on 60 articles. For the present review, nine
      studies were considered eligible to be included for qualitative analysis. CBCT
      performed similar to intraoral radiography in mesiodistal defect detection and
      measurements. Additional buccolingual visualisation and volumetric and
      morphological assessment of peri-implant bone defects are major advantages of 3D 
      visualisation with CBCT. Nevertheless, one must be aware of metal artefacts
      masking osseointegration, shallow bony defects and other peri-implant
      radiolucencies, thus impeding early diagnosis of intrabony lesions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The present review did not provide evidence to support the use of CBCT as
      standard postoperative procedure to evaluate peri-implant bone. Up to date, we
      are clinically forced to remain with intraoral radiography, notwithstanding the
      inherent limitations related to restricted field of view and two-dimensional
      overlap. A 3D imaging approach for postoperative implant evaluation is crucial,
      making further development of an optimised and artefact-free CBCT protocol
      indispensable.

TI  - Foreign body reactions, marginal bone loss and allergies in relation to titanium 
      implants.
PG  - S37-S46
AB  - AIM: To describe general observations of immunological reactions to foreign
      materials and to realize that CP titanium gives rise to a foreign body reaction
      with subsequent bone embedment when placed as oral implants. To analyse the
      possibility of titanium allergy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present paper is of a
      narrative review type. Hand and Medline searches were performed to evaluate
      marginal bone loss of oral implants and the potential of titanium allergy.
      RESULTS: Immunological reactions to foreign substances include Type I
      hypersensitivity reactions such as allergy, Type II hypersensitivity reactions
      characterised by IgM or IgG antibodies that may react with blood group antigens
      at transfusion, and Type III hypersensitivity caused by antigen-antibody immune
      complexes exemplified by acute serum sickness. There is also Type IV
      hypersensitivity, or delayed hypersensitivity, which is typically found in drug
      and foreign body reactions. It proved very difficult to find a universally
      acceptable definition of reasons for marginal bone loss around oral implants,
      which lead to most varying figures of so-called peri-implantitis being 1% to 2%
      in some 10-year follow-up papers to between 28% and 56% of all placed implants in
      other papers. It was recognised that bone resorption to oral as well as
      orthopaedic implants may be due to immunological reactions. Today,
      osseointegration is seen as an immune-modulated inflammatory process where the
      immune system is locally either up- or downregulated. Titanium implant allergy is
      a rare condition, if it exists. The authors found only two papers presenting
      strong evidence of allergy to CP titanium, but with the lack of universally
      accepted and tested patch tests, the precise diagnosis is difficult. CONCLUSIONS:
      CP titanium acts as a foreign body when placed in live tissues. There may be
      immunological reasons behind marginal bone loss. Titanium allergy may exist in
      rare cases, but there is a lack of properly designed and analysed patch tests at 
      present.

      modification with new method of polymer grafting.

AB  - A significant number of hip replacements (HR) fail permanently despite the
      success of the medical procedure, due to wear and progressive loss of
      osseointegration of implants. An ideal model should consist of materials with a
      high resistance to wear and with good biocompatibility. This study aims to
      develop a new method of grafting the surface of selective laser melted (SLM)
      titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) with poly (2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine)
      (PMPC), to improve the surface properties and biocompatibility of the implant.
      PMPC was grafted onto the SLM fabricated Ti-6Al-4V, applying the following three 
      techniques; ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, thermal heating both under normal
      atmosphere and UV irradiation under N2 gas atmosphere. Scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM), 3D optical profiler, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
      (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared
      spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to characterise the grafted surface. Results
      demonstrated that a continuous PMPC layer on the Ti-6Al-4V surface was achieved
      using the UV irradiation under N2 gas atmosphere technique, due to the
      elimination of oxygen from the system. As indicated in the results, one of the
      advantages of this technique is the presence of phosphorylcholine, mostly on the 
      surface, which reveals the existence of a strong chemical bond between the
      grafted layer (PMPC) and substrate (Ti-6Al-4V). The nano-scratch test revealed
      that the PMPC grafted surface improves the mechanical strength of the surface and
      thus, protects the underlying implant substrate from scratching under high loads.

AB  - A three-dimensional (3D) X-ray tomogram evaluation gives a full view of the bone 
      distribution around an entire implant in contrast to the often-used
      two-dimensional (2D) histological methods. High-resolution X-ray absorption
      tomography was used to evaluate the 3D bone growth around dental implants in an
      experimental goat mandible reconstruction model. The tomograms allowed for the
      construction of virtual histological cross-sections that could be used to
      evaluate the statistical uncertainty of the histological methods, which was the
      purpose of this paper. The virtual 2D histological results showed a significantly
      higher uncertainty within the same sample than did the full 3D volume results.

PG  - e00662

AB  - Objectives: The aims of this study were to create a new surface topography using 
      simulated body fluids (SBF) and Gold Nanoparticles (GNPs) and then to assess the 
      influence of UV Photofunctionalization (PhF) on the osteogenic capacity of these 
      surfaces. Materials and methods: Titanium plates were divided into six groups All
      were acid etched with 67% Sulfuric acid, 4 were immersed in SBF and 2 of these
      were treated with 10 nm GNPs. Half of the TiO2 plates were photofunctionalized to
      be compared with the non-PhF ones. Rat's bone marrow stem cells were seeded into 
      the plates and then CCK8 assay, cell viability assay, immunofluorescence, and
      Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were done after 24 hours. Gene expression
      analysis was done using real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) one week later to check
      for the mRNA expression of Collagen-1, Osteopontin and Osteocalcin. Alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP) activity was assessed after 2 weeks of cell seeding. Results:
      Our new topography has shown remarkable osteogenic potential. The new surface was
      the most biocompatible, and the 10 nm GNPs did not show any cytotoxicity. There
      was a significant increase in bioactivity, enhanced gene expressions and ALP
      activity. Conclusions: GNPs enhances osteogenic differentiation of stem cells and
      Photofunctionalizing GNPs highly increases this. We have further created a novel 
      highly efficient topography which highly enhances the speed and extent of
      osseointegration. This may have great potential for improving treatment outcomes 
      for implant, maxillofacial as well as orthopedic patients.

TI  - Comparison of polyetheretherketone versus silicon nitride intervertebral spinal
      spacers in a caprine model.
PG  - 688-699
LID - 10.1002/jbm.b.34162 [doi]
AB  - Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is commonly used as a spinal spacer for
      intervertebral fusion surgery. Unfortunately, PEEK is bioinert and does not
      effectively osseointegrate into living bone. In contrast, comparable spacers made
      of silicon nitride (Si3 N4 ) possess a surface nanostructure and chemistry that
      encourage appositional bone healing. This observational study was designed to
      compare the outcomes of these two biomaterials when implanted as spacers in an
      adult caprine model. Lumbar interbody fusion surgeries were performed at two
      adjacent levels in eight adult goats using implants of PEEK and Si3 N4 . At
      six-months after surgery, the operative and adjacent spinal segments were
      extracted and measured for bone fusion, bone volume, bone-implant contact (BIC)
      and soft-tissue implant contact (SIC) ratios, and biodynamic stability. The null 
      hypothesis was that no differences in these parameters would be apparent between 
      the two groups. Fusion was observed in seven of eight implants in each group with
      greater bone formation in the Si3 N4 group (52.6%) versus PEEK (27.9%; p = 0.2). 
      There were no significant differences in BIC ratios between PEEK and Si3 N4 , and
      the biodynamic stability of the two groups was also comparable. The results
      suggest that Si3 N4 spacers are not inferior to PEEK and they may be more
      effective in promoting arthrodesis. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

AB  - This article describes the prosthetic treatment of a patient suffering from a
      hemimaxillary defect after surgical resection of an adenoid cystic carcinoma
      (ACC) in the palate. The patient had also received therapeutic irradiation. One
      year after radiotherapy, three implants were placed in the remaining maxillary
      bone without any bone augmentation. One of the implants failed during the
      osseointegration period. The implant replacing the failed one also failed during 
      prosthetic procedures. The patient was unwilling to undergo another surgical
      episode, and the final prosthesis was completed on the two remaining implants.

PG  - 2041731418789838
LID - 10.1177/2041731418789838 [doi]
AB  - The use of biomaterials in orthopaedics for joint replacement, fracture healing
      and bone regeneration is a rapidly expanding field. Infection of these
      biomaterials is a major healthcare burden, leading to significant morbidity and
      mortality. Furthermore, the cost to healthcare systems is increasing
      dramatically. With advances in implant design and production, research has
      predominately focussed on osseointegration; however, modification of implant
      material, surface topography and chemistry can also provide antibacterial
      activity. With the increasing burden of infection, it is vitally important that
      we consider the bacterial interaction with the biomaterial and the host when
      designing and manufacturing future implants. During this review, we will
      elucidate the interaction between patient, biomaterial surface and bacteria. We
      aim to review current and developing surface modifications with a view towards
      antibacterial orthopaedic implants for clinical applications.

TI  - The effect of osseodensification drilling for endosteal implants with different
      surface treatments: A study in sheep.
PG  - 615-623
LID - 10.1002/jbm.b.34154 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the effects of osseodensification drilling on the
      stability and osseointegration of machine-cut and acid-etched endosteal implants 
      in low-density bone. Twelve sheep received six implants inserted into the ilium, 
      bilaterally (n = 36 acid-etched, and n = 36 as-machined). Individual animals
      received three implants of each surface, placed via different surgical
      techniques: (1) subtractive regular-drilling (R): 2.0 mm pilot, 3.2 and 3.8 mm
      twist drills); (2) osseodensification clockwise-drilling (CW): Densah Bur
      (Versah, Jackson, MI) 2.0 mm pilot, 2.8, and 3.8 mm multifluted tapered burs; and
      (3) osseodensification counterclockwise-drilling (CCW) Densah Bur 2.0 mm pilot,
      2.8 mm, and 3.8 mm multifluted tapered burs. Insertion torque was higher in the
      CCW and CW-drilling compared to the R-drilling (p < 0.001). Bone-to-implant
      contact (BIC) was significantly higher for CW (p = 0.024) and CCW-drilling (p =
      0.006) compared to the R-drilling technique. For CCW-osseodensification-drilling,
      no statistical difference between the acid-etched and machine-cut implants at
      both time points was observed for BIC and BAFO (bone-area-fraction-occupancy).
      Resorbed bone and bone forming precursors, preosteoblasts, were observed at
      3-weeks. At 12-weeks, new bone formation was observed in all groups extending to 
      the trabecular region. In low-density bone, endosteal implants inserted via
      osseodensification-drilling presented higher stability and no osseointegration
      impairments compared to subtractive regular-drilling technique, regardless of
      evaluation time or implant surface. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

TI  - Reflection of an ultrasonic wave on the bone-implant interface: A numerical study
      of the effect of the multiscale roughness.
PG  - 488
LID - 10.1121/1.5046524 [doi]
AB  - Quantitative ultrasound is used to characterize and stimulate osseointegration
      processes at the bone-implant interface (BII). However, the interaction between
      an ultrasonic wave and the implant remains poorly understood. This study aims at 
      investigating the sensitivity of the ultrasonic response to the microscopic and
      macroscopic properties of the BII and to osseointegration processes. The
      reflection coefficient R of the BII was modeled for different frequencies using a
      two-dimensional finite element model. The implant surface roughness was modeled
      by a sinusoidal function with varying amplitude h and spatial frequency L. A soft
      tissue layer of thickness W was considered between bone tissue and the implant in
      order to model non-mineralized fibrous tissue. For microscopic roughness, R is
      shown to increase from around 0.55 until 0.9 when kW increases from 0 to 1 and to
      be constant for kW > 1, where k is the wavenumber in the implant. These results
      allow us to show that R depends on the properties of bone tissue located at a
      distance comprised between 1 and 25 mum from the implant surface. For macroscopic
      roughness, R is highly dependent on h and this dependence may be explained by
      phase cancellation and multiple scattering effects for high roughness parameters.

LID - 10.1111/joor.12702 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate presumptive differences in osseointegration at implants installed in 
      healed sites or extraction sockets, supporting either crowns or bridges that were
      functionally loaded or left unloaded. In six dogs, the mesial roots of the first 
      mandibular molars were treated endodontically. Bilaterally, the teeth were
      hemisected, and the distal roots extracted. First and second mandibular premolars
      were extracted as well. After 3 months, the mandibular third and fourth distal
      roots were extracted after endodontic treatment of the mesial roots. Four
      implants were installed bilaterally, two in the healed sites corresponding to the
      second premolar and first molar regions, and two into the extraction sockets.
      Cobalt-chrome single crowns were prepared and installed in the two most anterior 
      implants, and bridges at the two most posterior implants, bilaterally. A 3-unit
      bridge was applied to the premolars in the upper jaw only at the loaded sites.
      All prostheses had a flat occlusal surface and contacts in centric occlusion only
      at the loaded sites. Three months later, biopsies were retrieved for histological
      analysis. Higher levels of osseointegration and bone density were observed at the
      unloaded sites, both at implants installed in healed and post-extraction sites.
      However, only at implants installed in the post-extraction sites and supporting
      single crowns, the difference in bone-to-Implant contact was statistically
      significant. In implant installation immediately following extraction or delayed 
      after three months, osseointegration and bone density were not affected by
      occlusal contact schemes.

TI  - Biomechanical Evaluation of Nano-Zirconia Coatings on Ti-6Al-7Nb Implant Screws
      in Rabbit Tibias.
PG  - 530-537
LID - 10.1007/s11596-018-1911-4 [doi]
AB  - The clinical success of dental implants can be improved by achieving optimum
      implant properties, such as their biomechanical and surface characteristics.
      Nano-structured coatings can play an important role in improving the implant
      surface. The purpose of the present study was to determine the most appropriate
      conditions for electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of nano-zirconia coatings on
      Ti-6Al-7Nb substrates and to evaluate the structural and biomechanical
      characteristics of these deposited coatings on the dental implants. EPD was used 
      with different applied voltages and time periods to obtain a uniform layer of
      nano-zirconia on Ti-6Al-7Nb samples. The coated samples were weighed and the
      thickness of the product layer was measured. Surface analysis was performed by
      using optical microscopical examination, scanning electron microscope and X-ray
      diffraction phase analysis. For in vivo examination, 48 screw-designed implants
      (24 uncoated and 24 nano-zirconia coated) were implanted in both tibiae of 12
      white New Zealand rabbits and evaluated biomechanically after 4- and 12-week
      healing intervals. Results revealed that the use of different conditions for EPD 
      affected the final coating film properties. Increasing the applied voltage and
      coating time period increased the deposited nano-zirconia film thickness and
      weight. By selecting the appropriate coating conditions, and analyzing scanning
      electron microscopical examination and XRD patterns, this technique could produce
      a thin and continuous nano-zirconia layer with a uniform thickness of the
      Ti-6Al-7Nb samples. Mechanically, the nano-zirconia-coated implants showed a
      highly statistically significant difference in removal torque values, while
      histologically these coated implants enhanced and promoted osseointegration after
      4 and 12 weeks of healing, compared with the uncoated ones. In conclusion, EPD is
      an effective technique for providing a high quality nano-zirconia coating film on
      dental implant surfaces. Moreover, the osseointegration of these coated dental
      implants is improved compared with that of uncoated ones.

TI  - Custom-made root-analogue zirconia implants: A scoping review on mechanical and
      biological benefits.
PG  - 2888-2900
LID - 10.1002/jbm.b.34147 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to conduct a literature review on the potential
      benefits of custom-made root-analogue zirconia implants. A PubMed and
      ScienceDirect bibliographical search was carried out from 1969 to 2017. The
      increased interest in zirconia-based dental structures linked to aesthetic and
      biological outcomes have been reported in literature. Recent technological
      advances have focused on novel strategies for modification of zirconia-based
      surfaces to accelerate osseointegration. However, only a few studies revealed
      mechanical and biological benefits of custom-made root-analogue zirconia implants
      and therefore further studies should investigate the influence of different
      design and surface modification on the performance of such implants. Custom-made 
      root-analogue zirconia implants have become a viable alternative to overcome
      limitations concerning stress distribution, aesthetics, and peri-implantitis
      induced by biofilms. However, further in vitro and in vivo studies on
      surface-bone interactions and mechanical behavior of zirconia should be evaluated
      to reduce clinical issues regarding mechanical failures and late peri-implant
      bone loss. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl

TI  - A single center retrospective clinical evaluation of anterior cervical discectomy
      and fusion comparing allograft spacers to silicon nitride cages.
PG  - 349-360
LID - 10.21037/jss.2018.06.02 [doi]
AB  - Background: Iliac crest autograft or allograft spacers have been traditionally
      utilized in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) to provide vertebral
      stabilization and enhanced osteogenesis. However, abiotic cages have largely
      replaced these allogenic sources due to host-site morbidities and disease
      transmission risks, respectively. Although devices made of polyetheretherketone
      (PEEK) or titanium-alloys (Ti) have gained wide popularity, they lack
      osteoinductive or conductive capabilities. In contrast, silicon nitride (Si3N4)
      is a relatively new implant material that also provides structural stability and 
      yet purportedly offers osteopromotive and antimicrobial behavior. This study
      compared radiographic outcomes at >/=12 months of follow-up for osseous
      integration, fusion rate, time to fusion, and subsidence in ACDF patients with
      differing intervertebral spacers. Methods: Fifty-eight ACDF patients (108
      segments) implanted with Si3N4 cages were compared to thirty-four similar ACDF
      patients (61 segments) implanted with fibular allograft spacers. Lateral
      radiographs (normal, flexion, and extension) were obtained at 3, 6, 12, and 24
      months to assess osseous integration, the presence of bridging bone, the absence 
      of peri-implant radiolucencies, subsidence, and fusion using both interspinous
      distance (ISD) and Cobb angle methods. Results: In patients with >/=12 months of 
      follow-up, fusion for the allograft spacers and Si3N4 cages was 86.84% and
      96.83%, respectively (ISD method, P=0.10), and 67.65% and 84.13%, respectively
      (Cobb angle method P=0.07), while osseointegration was 76.32% and 93.65%,
      respectively (P=0.02). The time to fusion significantly favored the Si3N4 cages
      (4.08 vs. 8.64 months (ISD method, P=0.01), and 6.76 vs. 11.74 months (Cobb angle
      method, P=0.04). The assessed time for full osseointegration was 7.83 and 19.24
      months for Si3N4 and allograft, respectively (P=0.00). Average subsidence at
      1-year follow-up was 0.51 and 2.71 mm for the Si3N4 and allograft cohorts,
      respectively (P=0.00). Conclusions: In comparison to fibular allograft spacers,
      Si3N4 cages showed earlier osseointegration and fusion, higher fusion rates, and 
      less subsidence.

      Osseointegration of Dental Implants: A 5-year Retrospective Study.
PG  - 842-846
AB  - AIM: Dental implants are the preferred treatment modality in the present
      edentulous era. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have detrimental 
      effect on bone density. The present study was conducted to determine the effect
      of SSRIs on the success rate of dental implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      present study was conducted on 352 patients of both genders with 680 dental
      implants. History of depression and SSRI medication was retrieved. Patients were 
      divided into two groups. Group I (110 patients, 230 dental implants) patients
      were on SSRI, while group II (242 patients, 450 dental implants) patients were
      non-SSRI. In all patients, the implant failure rate was recorded. RESULTS: In
      group I, 35 patients were >50 years, while 75 were <50 years of age. In group II,
      60 patients were >50 years, while 182 were <50 years of age. The difference was
      significant (p < 0.05). Group I had 45 males and 65 females, while group II
      comprised of 105 males and 137 females. Group I showed 25 implant failures and
      group II had 21 implant failures. Age group >50 years showed 12 implant failures 
      while <50 years had 13 in group I compared with 10 in patients >50 years and 11
      in patients with <50 years of age; 56% smokers had implant in group I as compared
      with 60% failure in group II. In group I, 27% diabetic patients had failures as
      compared with 13.4% in group II. The difference was significant (p < 0.05). Group
      I showed maximum failures in terms of loosening of screw (8) followed by fracture
      of implant (7), peri-implantitis (6), and fracture of screw (4), whereas in group
      II, 7 cases were of loosening of screw, 6 cases were of fracture of screw, 5
      cases of fracture of implant, and 3 cases of peri-implantitis. The difference was
      nonsignificant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      cause increased osteoclastic activity, leading to bone loss and implants placed
      in patients with history of depression are more prone to failures. CLINICAL
      SIGNIFICANCE: Failure rates of dental implants are significantly increased in
      patients taking SSRIs due to depression. Careful case analysis and history of
      depression may minimize the failure rates.

TI  - Resistance of coated polyetheretherketone lumbar interbody fusion cages against
      abrasion under simulated impaction into the disc space.
PG  - 2280800018782854
LID - 10.1177/2280800018782854 [doi]
AB  - In order to improve osseointegration, polyetheretherketone (PEEK) interbody
      fusion cages are frequently surface coated. The bonding strength of the coatings 
      is mostly investigated under unrealistic loading conditions. To close this gap,
      in this study, uncoated and coated cages were loaded in a clinical setup in order
      to investigate their real resistance against abrasion. Six uncoated, six calcium 
      phosphate (CaP) nanocoated, and six titanium (Ti) nanocoated PEEK cages were
      tested in this study. The experimental setup was designed to mimic cage impaction
      into the intervertebral disc space using polyurethane (PU) foam blocks as
      vertebral body substitutes. The cage surface was inspected before and after
      impaction, and their weight was measured. Impaction resulted in abrasion at the
      tip of the ridges on the implant surface. The mean weight loss was 0.39 mg for
      the uncoated cages, 0.57 mg for the CaP nanocoated cages, and 0.75 mg for the Ti 
      nanocoated cages. These differences were statistically significant. In
      conclusion, differences between the three cage types were found concerning the
      amount of abrasion. However, all three cages lost less weight than a comparative 
      Ti plasma spray coated cage, which showed a mean weight loss of 2.02 mg. This may
      be because the plasma spray coating is significantly thicker than the two
      nanocoatings. If compared with the permitted amount of weight loss derived from
      an FDA guidance document, which is approximately 1.7 mg, the wear of the Ti
      plasma spray coated cage is above this limit, whereas the wear for all other cage
      types is below.

TI  - Osseointegration of ultrafine-grained titanium with a hydrophilic nano-patterned 
      surface: an in vivo examination in miniature pigs.
PG  - 2448-2459
LID - 10.1039/c8bm00671g [doi]
AB  - Advances in biomaterials science and implant surface technology have made dental 
      implants more predictable and implant therapy more attractive to patients.
      Surgical interventions are becoming less invasive, and patients heal faster and
      suffer less morbidity. In this preclinical in vivo study, we compared a new
      ultra-fine grained titanium (ufgTi) implant material with a hydrophilic
      nano-patterned surface to commercially pure titanium (cpTi) in a well-established
      animal model. CpTi grade 4 was subjected to Equal Channel Angular Pressing
      (ECAP), followed by a cold drawing process that provided ultra-fine-grained
      titanium (ufgTi) with a mean grain size of 300 nm. After metallographic
      assessment, the surface topography was characterized by laser confocal microscopy
      and atomic force microscopy. UfgTi and cpTi implants were inserted in the
      mandible and maxilla of miniature pigs that healed for 4 and for 8 weeks.
      Osseointegration was assessed by biomechanical torque out analysis,
      histomorphometric evaluation, and micro-CT analysis. The metallographic
      properties of UfgTi were significantly better than those of cpTi. Their surface
      topographies had similar hydrophilic nano-patterned characteristics, with no
      significant differences in the nanometre range. Histomorphometric and
      biomechanical torque out analysis revealed no significant differences between
      ufgTi and cpTi in environments of either low (maxilla) or high (mandible) bone
      density. We obtained high bone-to-implant contact values irrespective of the bony
      microarchitecture even when the bone mineral density was low. Overall, this
      investigation suggests that ufgTi forms a hydrophilic nano-patterned surface with
      superior metallographic properties compared to cpTi and high levels of
      osseointegration. Thus, ufgTi has therapeutic potential as a future strategy for 
      the development of small diameter implants to enable less invasive treatment
      concepts, reduce patient morbidity and may also lower the costs of patient care.

TI  - 5-year clinical and radiographic follow-up of the uncemented Symax hip stem in an
      international study.
PG  - 191
LID - 10.1186/s13018-018-0888-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The uncemented Symax hip stem is developed through optimization of
      the uncemented Omnifit hip stem. The Symax stem design combines an anatomical
      anteverted proximal geometry with a straight distal section. The proximal part is
      coated with a biomimetic hydroxyapatite (HA) coating for improved
      osseointegration to enhance load transfer and to minimize proximal bone loss. The
      distal part is treated with an anodization surface treatment in order to prevent 
      distal bone apposition, which is expected to prevent distal loading and reduce
      proximal stress shielding. Aim of this study is to report mid-term clinical
      performance and evaluate whether the radiographic features are in line with the
      design principles of the Symax hip. METHODS: The biomimetic hydroxyapatite-coated
      uncemented Symax hip stem was evaluated in 80 patients during a 5-year
      prospective clinical international study. Harris Hip Score (HHS), Oxford Hip
      Score (OHS), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index
      (WOMAC) were performed preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 months and 1, 2, 3
      and 5 years. Anteroposterior radiographs of the pelvis and axial radiographs of
      the operated hips were evaluated immediately postoperative and at follow-up 6
      months and 1, 2, 3, and 5 years. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyse
      whether clinical outcome scores changed statistically significant over time. The 
      overall percentage of agreement between two radiology assessment teams was used
      to evaluate observer agreement of radiology results. The Cohen's Kappa was
      evaluated as a measure of reliability to quantify the agreement between raters,
      corrected for chance agreement. RESULTS: Clinical outcome scores were excellent
      at 5 years with mean HHS of 98.1, mean OHS of 16.2 and mean WOMAC of 6.9. Only
      2.7% of the patients had pain at rest or on weight-bearing, and mid-thigh pain
      was reported by 1.4% of the patients after 5 years. The percentage of agreement
      between radiology assessment teams was 94 to 100%, except for distal line
      formation (48%). Radiographic evaluation showed stable stems and signs of
      excellent progressive proximal fixation and favourable bone remodeling.
      CONCLUSIONS: The excellent mid-term clinical and radiographic performances are in
      line with the design principles and coating properties of this new implant and
      earlier published results. TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://ClinicalTrials.gov ,

TI  - Sika deer antler as a novel model to investigate dental implant healing: A pilot 
      experimental study.
PG  - e0200957
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0200957 [doi]
AB  - Dental implants are important tools for restoring the loss of teeth. The rapid
      growth and periodic regeneration of antlers make Sika deer a good and less
      invasive alternative model for studying bone remodelling in mammals. We developed
      a special loading device for antlers and analysed the bone reaction around
      unloaded implants and under immediate loading conditions until osseointegration
      occurred. In micro-computed tomography images, the density of antler tissue
      around the implants increased as the loading time increased. This finding was
      histologically confirmed by the good osseointegration observed in unloaded and
      loaded specimens. Antler tissue displays a similar healing process to human bone.
      The use of an antler model is a promising alternative for implant studies that
      does not require animal sacrifice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone tunnel widening after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
      reconstruction is a known complication that can lead to graft failure. Subsequent
      revision surgery typically involves a two-stage procedure. The aim of this study 
      was to test a novel autologous tendon graft retaining muscle tissue combined with
      Human Recombinant Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (rh-BMP-2) leading to rapid
      ossification of the muscle tissue, simultaneously replenishing bone stock and
      producing a mechanically stable bone-tendon insertion. METHODS: In 12 skeletally 
      mature New Zealand rabbits, the ACL was resected and oversized bone tunnels were 
      drilled to model tunnel widening. The ipsilateral semitendinosus muscle-tendon
      graft was harvested and folded twice. Muscle tissue was removed in the middle
      third but retained at both distal ends. One side was wrapped in a collagen sponge
      loaded with rh-BMP-2 while the other end was used as its own control. RESULTS:
      All animals were euthanized after six weeks. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT)
      was used to analyze bone formation in 12 animals, with additional biomechanical
      testing to failure and histology performed for six animals each. Micro-CT showed 
      that bone densities were higher by a factor of 2.4 in treated graft ends compared
      with their controls. Biomechanical testing showed a mean overall failure load of 
      37.5N. Histology showed that the trabecular bone surrounding the implant was
      significantly (P=0.0087) thicker on the treated (85.5mum) compared with the
      control side (68.2mum). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a semitendinosus graft
      retaining the muscle tissue stimulated by recombinant Bone Morphogenetic
      Protein-2 (BMP-2) allows robust osseointegration of the graft within an oversized
      bone tunnel in an animal model.

AB  - The work proposes the development of heterogeneous bio-implants with the aim to
      minimize stress shielding effect and enhance bone ingrowth. Stress shielding in
      the implant can be minimized by reducing the overall stiffness of the implant,
      which is achieved here by varying the material based on stress distribution
      across the prosthesis. To increase overall stability of the implant by
      simultaneous enhancing osseointegration and reducing stress shielding, the work
      proposes the design of heterogeneous prosthesis with graded porosity and material
      having radial, axial and mixed (simultaneous radial and axial) variations. Static
      analysis for material variation models and consolidation analysis for graded
      porosity and material variation models are performed. After comparisons of
      results among different models, radial variation model was observed to deliver
      the results.

      removal tests.
PG  - 683-691
LID - 10.1111/cid.12645 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osseointegration of dental implants is a key factor for their
      success. It can be assessed either by destructive (eg, pullout or torque
      extraction), or nondestructive methods (eg, resonant frequency analysis).
      However, as of today there is a scarcity of models that can relate the outcome of
      destructive tests to the level of osseointegration. PURPOSE: To study various
      percentages of bone to implant bonding (tie) using finite element simulations.
      While evolutions of the bone mechanical properties are not explicitly taken into 
      account, emphasis is put on the 3-dimensional variable extent of the bone-implant
      bonding, its statistical distribution, and its influence on the measurable
      extraction and torque loads, seeking to obtain a quantitative relationship.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed numerical simulations of randomly tied
      implants and calculated the evolution of the pullout force as well as that of the
      extraction torque. CONCLUSION: Within simplifying assumptions for the
      osseointegration represented by a tie (as opposed to frictional) constraint, the 
      results of this work indicate that the torque test is more discriminant than the 
      extraction one, while both cannot really discriminate osseointegration levels
      below a relative variation of 20%.

TI  - Influence of the Thermal Treatment to Address a Better Osseointegration of
      Ti6Al4V Dental Implants: Histological and Histomorphometrical Study in a Rabbit
      Model.
PG  - 2349698
LID - 10.1155/2018/2349698 [doi]
AB  - Background: Pure titanium continues to be the first choice for dental implants
      and represents the gold standard for their biocompatibility and physical and
      mechanical characteristics, while the titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) has good
      mechanical properties. The surface structure of the titanium oxide layer
      formation on the surface influences and improves the bone response around dental 
      implants. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of a
      thermal treatment of Ti6Al4V implant surfaces and the bone healing response in a 
      rabbit model. Methods: Altogether sixteen implants with same design were inserted
      into the distal femoral metaphysis. A screw (13 mm long, 4 mm in diameter) was
      inserted in an implant bed. Each rabbit received two implants, one in the left
      femur and one in the right femur. The samples were histologically and
      histomorphometrically evaluated at 8 weeks. Results: A statistically significant 
      difference (p = 0.000034) was present histologically in the percentages of
      bone-implant contact (BIC) between the test group (BIC = 69.25+/-4.49%.) and
      control group (BIC = 56.25 +/- 4.8%) by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
      Significance was set at p </= 0.05. Conclusions: The outcome of the present study
      indicates a novel approach to improving bone healing around titanium implants.

      Implants.
PG  - 4121639
LID - 10.1155/2018/4121639 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of total implant-bone
      surface contact area of dental implants applied on partial or total edentulous
      patients on the increase in the level of blood titanium level. Changes of the
      blood titanium levels were evaluated after placement of the dental implants in 30
      patients including 15 females and 15 males. Patients were divided into 3 groups
      as dental implants were applied on only maxilla, only mandible, or both of them. 
      Taking into the consideration anatomic formation and prosthetic indication,
      dental implant-bone total contact area was calculated and saved for each patient 
      after dental implants placement. Blood samples of the patients taken
      preoperatively and postoperatively at 12 weeks were analyzed by ICP-MS device.
      Blood titanium levels of preoperative and postoperative blood samples were
      analyzed for each patient and results were evaluated statistically. In the
      evaluation after analyzing blood titanium level changes, while a statistically
      significant decrease was observed in Group 1 patients, a statistically
      significant increase was observed in Group 2 and Group 3 patients to blood
      titanium level. A statistically significant difference was observed between Group
      1 and Group 2 and between Group 1 and Group 3 patients of blood titanium levels. 
      The change of the blood titanium level was not related to total implant-bone
      surface area, number of the implants, and gender. In our study, no correlation
      was found between change of blood titanium level and total contact area with bone
      of dental implants. We believe that more accurate results can be obtained with
      biopsy of tissues and organs on animal studies.

LID - D2611 [pii]
AB  - Since its introduction in 2009, more than 150 people in the Netherlands have
      received an osseointegration prosthesis following leg amputation. Serious
      complications such as septic or aseptic loosening and breakage of the implant are
      rare. In this article we highlight the results so far, the indications and
      contra-indications, our first experiences with patients who have undergone
      amputation due to vascular disease, and the future of osseointegration treatment 
      in the Netherlands.

LID - 10.1111/cid.12630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical outcome of "simpli5y" concept
      where in 3 and 2 implant placed cross arch in maxilla and in mandible
      respectively, restored with screw retained prosthesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Total of 30 patients were randomized, with 15 in group1 with an average of 45 Ncm
      insertion torque with delayed loading and 15 in group 2 with above 65 Ncm
      inertion torque with immediate loading with equal number of male and female in
      each group following parallel design with 3 implants in maxillary and 2 implants 
      in mandibular arch placed which was supported by a 3Dimensional finite analysis
      comparing the stress dissipation around implants of this concept-"Simplif5y" with
      All-on-4 concept. RESULTS: Von Mises strain recorded in the bone in the maxillary
      and mandibular arch models were higher in All-on-four than that in the
      "simpli5y", which was vice-versa in the framework. Three-year post loading
      marginal peri implant bone loss for the group 1 was less than group 2.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results, suggest that in both delayed loading and immediate
      loading protocol that cross arch prostheses can be successfully supported by 3
      and 2 implants in maxillary and mandibular arch respectively-"Simpli5y" concept
      of full mouth restoration.

AB  - The mechanisms of early failures in dental implant osseointegration are unclear. 
      A possible cause of low levels of bone formation is lubricant contamination on
      implants during insertion. To explore the impact of lubricant contamination on
      dental implants, we used 5 New Zealand rabbits and inserted 2 implants per tibia 
      in each animal for a total of 4 implants per animal (20 implants in total). In
      general, bicorticalization was achieved. The first implant was placed as
      suggested by the manufacturer with no lubricant used (control). The second
      implant was placed using a freshly lubricated contra-angle handpiece, which was
      used only for the test implants. Implant allocation was randomized, and the
      examining histologist was blinded to the results. All implants were placed by the
      same surgeon. The animals were maintained in accordance with animal
      experimentation guidelines. None of the implants failed to osseointegrate.
      Moreover, no significant difference was observed between the test and control
      groups. Based on the results of this study, the use of rotary instrument mineral 
      oil lubricant did not jeopardize the osseointegration of dental implants in New
      Zealand rabbits.

LID - 10.1155/2018/1672170 [doi]
AB  - In the reported clinical case, the immediate dentoalveolar restoration (IDR)
      technique was applied to reconstruct the buccal bone wall, with autogenous graft 
      of the maxillary tuberosity, which had been lost due to a root fracture, and to
      provide the necessary bone substrate for the installation of an implant and its
      provisioning. One of the greatest risks inherent in the survival of immediate
      implants is the maintenance of their stability during the healing period. In this
      case, due to a mechanical trauma in sports activity in the first postoperative
      month, there was a total failure in the osseointegration process, confirmed by
      tomographic examination of both the implant and the bone graft. The deleterious
      effects of this accident were compensated with a new approach and reapplication
      of IDR technique using a smaller-diameter implant and with conical macrogeometry 
      in conjunction with the new bone reconstruction under the same compromised
      alveolus; associated, after the period of osseointegration, with the maneuvers of
      volume increase of the gingival tissue by subepithelial connective tissue graft. 
      The tomographic result demonstrated the success of the surgical procedures, and
      the clinical/photographic analysis obtained showed the stability of the gingival 
      margin without compromising the esthetic result of the prosthetic restoration.

TI  - Development and biological evaluation of fluorophosphonate-modified
      hydroxyapatite for orthopaedic applications.
PG  - 122
LID - 10.1007/s10856-018-6130-9 [doi]
AB  - There is an incentive to functionalise hydroxyapatite (HA) for orthopaedic
      implant use with bioactive agents to encourage superior integration of the
      implants into host bone. One such agent is (3S) 1-fluoro-3-hydroxy-4-(oleoyloxy) 
      butyl-1-phosphonate (FHBP), a phosphatase-resistant lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)
      analogue. We investigated the effect of an FHBP-HA coating on the maturation of
      human (MG63) osteoblast-like cells. Optimal coating conditions were identified
      and cell maturation on modified and unmodified, control HA surfaces was assessed.
      Stress tests were performed to evaluate coating survivorship after exposure to
      mechanical and thermal insults that are routinely encountered in the clinical
      environment. MG63 maturation was found to be three times greater on FHBP-modified
      HA compared to controls (p < 0.0001). There was no significant loss of coating
      bioactivity after autoclaving (P = 0.9813) although functionality declined by 67%
      after mechanical cleaning and reuse (p < 0.0001). The bioactivity of modified
      disks was significantly greater than that of controls following storage for up to
      six months (p < 0.001). Herein we demonstrate that HA can be functionalised with 
      FHBP in a facile, scalable manner and that this novel surface has the capacity to
      enhance osteoblast maturation. Improving the biological performance of HA in a
      bone regenerative setting could be realised through the simple conjugation of
      bioactive LPA species in the future. Depicted is a stylised summary of
      hydroxyapatite (HA) surface modification using an analogue of lysophosphatidic
      acid, FHBP. a HA surfaces are simply steeped in an aqueous solution of 2 muM
      FHBP. b The polar head group of some FHBP molecules react with available hydroxyl
      residues at the mineral surfaces forming robust HA-O-P bonds leaving acyl chain
      extensions perpendicular to the HA surface. These fatty acyl chains provide
      points of integration for other FHBP molecules to facilitate their self-assembly.
      This final surface finish enhanced the human osteoblast maturation response to
      calcitriol, the active vitamin D3 metabolite.

AB  - Introduction: Zirconia bioceramic can be considered for metallic replacement in
      dental implant applications. A proper method of surface modification may promote 
      better osseointegration. Methods: In study evaluated viability of fibroblast cell
      following surface treatment. Therefore, viability L929 cells were characterized
      using MTT assay and scanning electron microscopy. Results: The viability
      assessment determined significant differences A-Y-TZP20 without surface treatment
      as compared to laser surface treatment (B), laser surface treatment +
      hydroxyapatiteyttrium stabilized tetragonal zirconia nanocomposite coat (C) and
      control. This study demonstrated that L929 cells approximately proliferated and
      spread on A-Y-TZP20 nanocomposite disk in laser surface treatment(B), Laser
      surface treatment + hydroxiapatite-yttrium stabilized tetragonal zirconia
      nanocomposite coat (C) groups similar to control group. Conclusion: Laser surface
      treatment showed positive effect on the viability of L929 cells.

      Patient: Case Report.
PG  - e107-e111
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6681 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have clearly shown that osseointegrated implants, when inserted
      in growing bone, such as in adolescents, do not follow the eruptive path of
      adjacent teeth; instead, they act like ankylosed teeth, remaining in a stationary
      position for the lifetime, thus developing a progressive infraposition of the
      implant-supported crown. However, further studies have demonstrated that similar 
      changes also occur in adult patients, although mostly in a small amount and over 
      long time spans. Here the case of a female patient aged 35 years is presented, in
      which infraposition of the maxillary central incisor developed in a very short
      time (15 months). The treatment provided was a combined orthodontic/prosthetic
      approach with a 4-year follow-up.

TI  - Molecular Assessment of Human Peri-implant Mucosal Healing at Laser-Modified and 
      Machined Titanium Abutments.
PG  - 895-904
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6367 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare, by gene profiling analysis, the molecular events
      underscoring peri-implant mucosa formation at machined vs laser-microgrooved
      implant healing abutments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty endosseous implants were 
      placed by a one-stage approach in 20 healthy subjects in nonadjacent sites for
      single-tooth restorations. In a split-mouth design, machined smooth and
      laser-microgrooved healing abutments were randomly assigned in each subject.
      Peri-implant mucosa adjacent to healing abutments was harvested by tissue punch
      biopsy at either 1, 2, 4, or 8 weeks following abutment placement. Total RNA was 
      isolated from the peri-implant transmucosal soft tissues. A whole genome
      microarray using the Affymetrix Human Gene 2.1 ST Array was performed to describe
      gene expression profiles in relation to abutment topography and healing time
      duration. Data analysis was completed using GeneSpring software v.12.6. RESULTS: 
      Differential gene expression was revealed at all time points and among surfaces. 
      Five hundred one genes were differentially expressed (fold change >/= 2.0) at
      machined versus laser-modified abutments, and 459 of these were statistically
      significant (P </= .05). At 1 week, unique expression of IL-24 and MMP1 was
      observed in tissues from laser-treated surfaces. At 2, 4, and 8 weeks, mRNAs
      encoding keratins and protective proteins of cornified epithelium were
      upregulated in tissues from laser-modified abutments. At 4 weeks, upregulation (>
      2-fold) of mRNAs encoding proteins associated with collagen fibril formation and 
      function was observed in tissue from laser-modified abutments. In both tissues of
      machined and laser-modified abutments, mRNAs encoding junctional
      epithelium-specific proteins, ostogenic ameloblast associated protein (ODAM) and 
      follicular dendritic cell secreted protein (FDCSP) were highly upregulated
      throughout weeks 2 to 8. CONCLUSION: Peri-implant abutment mucosal wound healing 
      involves selective differentiation of epithelium and induction of the junctional 
      epithelium. Laser-mediated alterations in abutment topography enhance collagen
      fibril-associated gene expression and alter epithelium/junctional epithelial gene
      expression. Clinically, shallower probing depths are measured at laser-mediated
      versus machined implant abutments.

TI  - Bone Volume Dynamics and Implant Placement Torque in Horizontal Bone Defects
      Reconstructed with Autologous or Xenogeneic Block Bone: A Randomized, Controlled,
      Split-Mouth, Prospective Clinical Trial.
PG  - 888-894
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6288 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate volumetric stability of autologous
      and xenogeneic block grafts and primary stability of implants in maxillary
      grafted areas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each patient received one autologous block 
      and xenogeneic block, both covered with a membrane. Bone thickness measurements
      clinically and tomographically were made before, immediately, and 6 months
      postoperatively. After 6 months, identical implants were placed in each grafted
      area, and primary stability was measured. RESULTS: Eight patients with anterior
      horizontal bone defects were selected. Clinical outcomes at 6 months postgrafting
      in the autologous block revealed a mean thickness of 7.4 +/- 1.6 mm, with an
      initial mean measurement of 3.4 +/- 1.7 mm and 2.6% resorption, whereas the mean 
      in the xenogeneic block was 8.9 +/- 1.5 mm, 3.3 +/- 1.6 mm, and 7.3%,
      respectively. Tomographic evaluation of the thickness at 6 months postgrafting in
      the autologous block was a mean 7.8 +/- 1.8 mm, with an initial mean of 3.7 +/-
      1.6 mm and resorption of 0%, while the mean in the xenogeneic block was 9.3 +/-
      1.6 mm, 3.6 +/- 1.4 mm, and 2.1%, respectively. No significant difference in bone
      thickness was observed immediately or 6 months after the procedure. The mean
      implant placement torque was 32 +/- 22 Ncm in the autologous block and 18 +/- 9
      Ncm in the xenogeneic block (P = .004). CONCLUSION: Xenogeneic block was shown to
      be a suitable alternative to reconstruct horizontal defects in the alveolar ridge
      that had undergone extensive resorption, though lower insertion torques were
      obtained during implant placement.

TI  - Correlation Between Implant Geometry, Implant Surface, Insertion Torque, and
      Primary Stability: In Vitro Biomechanical Analysis.
PG  - 824-830
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6285 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Primary implant stability represents the first step for successful
      osseointegration. The knowledge of the correlation between host bone density,
      insertion torque, and implant macrogeometry seems to be fundamental to achieve
      sufficient primary implant bone fixation in each clinical situation. The purpose 
      of this study was to measure, in vitro, the impact of dental implant
      macrogeometry and insertion torque values on primary stability in relation to
      different bone densities, representing both the human mandible and maxilla.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty 3.8 +/- 11-mm commercial dental
      implants were used. Forty implants had small threads with a machined neck, 40
      implants had small threads with a microthreaded neck, and the last 40 implants
      had large threads with a reverse neck design. Fresh bovine ribs, representing a
      medium-dense bone density (D2-D3), and fresh ovine iliac crest, representing a
      soft bone density (D4), were used. Insertion torque and micromobility under
      lateral force data were recorded for each implant. RESULTS: In the medium-dense
      bone type, the reverse neck implant design showed less primary implant stability 
      than the conventional straight implant neck. In soft bone, both implants with the
      large thread design and microthreaded neck implants showed better implant
      stability than the implant with a small thread design with a straight machined
      neck. Implants with large and self-cutting threads showed significantly (P < .05)
      lower micromobility values than other implants in postextractive sites in
      low-density bone. CONCLUSION: Implant geometries and bone density are the main
      factors involved in the degree of primary implant stability. Large-thread implant
      designs are highly desirable in cases of poor bone quality. Each implant geometry
      generates an insertion torque value, which is correlated to the stability of that
      specific implant in a specific bone quality, but the insertion torque is not an
      objective value to compare primary stability between different implant types.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the bone responses of chemically modified implants using the 
      plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition method with those of blasted
      implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The titanium implants were blasted with
      resorbable blasting media (RBM) and designated as controls. The ion-implanted
      implants were divided into two test groups, namely, calcium (Ca) and magnesium
      (Mg) implants. Six implants (two implants per group) were placed into the
      proximal tibias of 11 New Zealand white rabbits. Fluorochrome labeling was
      administered at 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. Resonance frequency analysis (RFA)
      was conducted immediately after surgery and at 6 weeks of healing. The removal
      torque was measured in half of the tibiae. The implants in another tibia were
      subjected to fluorescence analysis and histologic and histomorphometric
      evaluations. RESULTS: The fluorescence analysis suggested that osteoconductivity 
      was improved in the early osseointegration stages in the Ca and Mg implants. In
      the cortical region, the bone-to-implant contact in the Mg implants and the bone 
      area % in the Ca and Mg implants were higher than those in the RBM implants (P < 
      .05). All groups demonstrated similar biomechanical strengths with respect to the
      RFA and the removal torque measurements. CONCLUSION: The osseointegration speed
      and the bone contact were positively affected by the Ca and Mg ion implantation, 
      especially in the Mg implants, because of the synergistic effect. However, no
      remarkable differences were found in biomechanical strength in the later
      osseointegration stages.

TI  - Nanostructured titanium regulates osseointegration via influencing macrophage
      polarization in the osteogenic environment.
PG  - 4029-4043
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S163956 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Fabricating nanostructured surface topography represents the
      mainstream approach to induce osteogenesis for the next-generation bone implant. 
      In the past, the bone implant was designed to minimize host repulsive reactions
      in order to acquire biocompatibility. However, increasing reports indicate that
      the absence of an appropriate immune response cannot acquire adequate
      osseointegration after implantation in vivo. Materials and methods: We prepared
      different topographies on the surface of titanium (Ti) specimens by grinding,
      etching and anodizing, and they were marked as polished specimen (P), specimen
      with nanotubes (NTs) in small diameters (NT-30) and specimen with NTs in large
      diameters (NT-100). We evaluated the ability of different topographies of the
      specimen to induce osteogenic differentiation of mice bone marrow mesenchymal
      stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro and to induce osseointegration in vivo. Furthermore, 
      we investigated the effect of different topographies on the polarization and
      secretion of macrophages, and the effect of macrophage polarization on
      topography-induced osteogenic differentiation of mice BMSCs. Finally, we verified
      the effect of macrophage polarization on topography-induced osseointegration in
      vivo by using Cre*RBP-J(fl/fl) mice in which classically activated macrophage was
      restrained. Results: The osteogenic differentiation of mice BMSCs induced by
      specimen with different topographies was NT-100>NT-30>P, while the
      osseointegration induced by specimen with different topographies in vivo was
      NT-30>NT-100>P. In addition, specimen of NT-30 could induce more macrophages to
      M2 polarization, while specimen of P and NT-100 could induce more macrophages to 
      M1 polarization. When co-culture mice BMSCs and macrophages on specimen with
      different topographies, the osteogenic differentiation of mice BMSCs was
      NT-30>NT-100>/=P. The osseointegration induced by NT-100 in Cre*RBP-J(fl/fl) mice
      was much better than that of wild type mice. Conclusion: It is suggested that the
      intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of nanomaterials are not only crucial to
      evaluate the in vivo biocompatibility but also required to determine the final
      osseointegration. To clarify the immune response and osseointegration may be
      beneficial for the designation and optimization of the bone implant.

AB  - There is a need to reconstruct damaged hard tissue for several reasons that
      include traumatic or non-traumatic events, congenital abnormalities, or disease. 
      Damaged tissues stemming from these events can become a major issue in
      orthopedic, dental, and maxillofacial surgery. A study on numerous biomaterials
      revealed that calcium phosphates had been used in hard tissues reconstruction for
      more than 6 decades. Hydroxyapatite (HA) was the primary material used in
      orthopedics and dentistry. Hydroxyapatite (HA) is an inorganic mineral that has a
      typical apatite lattice structure as (A10(BO4)6C2) where A, B, and C are defined 
      by Ca, PO4, and OH. Pure HA contains 39.68% by weight calcium and 18% by weight
      phosphorus resulting in a Ca/P mole ratio of 1.67. In fact, there are commercial 
      HA products with Ca/P ratio bigger or smaller than 1.67. The variety in Ca/P
      ratio indicates the phase shift between tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and calcium
      oxide (CaO). HA with Ca/P ratio bigger than 1.67 comprises more CaO than TCP and 
      vice versa[1][2]. HA crystals present in the human body both inside bone and
      teeth. In term of human bone, the HA crystals as a bioactive ceramic cover 65 to 
      70% by weight of the bone. Furthermore, the architecture of the bone comprises of
      type-I collagen as an organic component and the HA as an inorganic component.
      These 2 components form a composite structure at the nanoscale, in which nano-HA 
      is interspersed in the collagen network. This composite forms mineralized
      collagen and is the precursor of biological mineralized tissue from tendons and
      skin to hard mineralized tissues such as bone and teeth. Moreover, in the bone,
      the HA crystals present in the shape of plates or needles, are about 40 to 60 nm 
      long, 20 nm wide, and 1.5 to 5 nm thick[3]. The arrangement of different HA
      crystalline sizes and shapes provides support for this tissue structural
      stability, hardness, and function[4][5]. With regard to the dental role of HA
      crystal, it covers 70 to 80% by weight of dentin and enamel. Within the human
      body, the enamel is the hardest substance consisting of relatively large HA
      crystals (25 nm thick, 40 to 120 nm wide, 160 to 1000 nm long)[6]. Different from
      bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Amelogenins and enamelins replace the
      function of collagen by providing a framework for mineralization. Besides, HA is 
      the main material of enamel that screens the diffuse reflectivity of light by
      covering the pores on the enamel surface, thus makes the appearances of enamel is
      semitranslucent[4][7]. Overall, the pressure-point in hard tissue reparation is
      on HA due to its chemical proportion that occupies the majority of hard tissue
      composition, and also its mechanical properties that support the tissue
      integrity[8]. Currently, HA is widely used as implant material due to its
      excellent osteoconductive property that supports osseointegration and
      osteogenesis processes. The biological response to HA implants is influenced by
      its raw-materials and synthesis process that make product properties vary.

AB  - Since ancient times, it has been a challenge to come up with the best way to
      replace missing teeth. Previously, dentures were the standard way of replacing
      lost teeth. Science, technology, and researchers have provided choices for better
      care of teeth and understanding of oral health, leading to solutions for most
      oral problems. Osseointegration has become the focus of modern implantology,
      leading to the introduction and refinement of the osseointegrated root form
      implant. Available implants vary in diameter from 1.8 mm to 7 mm. The mini
      implant is a dental implant that is fabricated with a reduced diameter (less than
      3 mm) and a shorter length but with the same biocompatible material as compared
      with standard dental implants. Mini implants present a reduced diameter (less
      than 3 mm), while narrow/conventional diameter implants typically have a diameter
      greater than 3 mm. Therefore, the use of mini implants to retain overdentures
      enables the use of less-complex surgical techniques since the reduced diameter of
      the implant permits its placement in areas with low bone thickness. These
      implants are associated with high survival rates, favorable marginal bone loss,
      and increased satisfaction and quality of life of patients. The quantity and
      quality of bone tissue available in the jaw typically define the characteristics 
      (diameter and length) and the number of implants. Overdentures retained by
      conventional implants exhibit good long-term results, but also present some
      limitations such as cost, difficulty with placing the implant in reduced
      buccolingual dimensions of bone without the need for bone-grafting procedures,
      and the presence of chronic systemic diseases that can prevent most advanced
      surgeries such as bone grafts and lateralization of the inferior alveolar nerve. 
      Concomitantly, sometimes it is not necessary to open flaps, decreasing morbidity 
      during the postoperative period. These aspects are some of the attractive factors
      that increase patient acceptance of mini implant treatments.

TI  - Benchmark for Tooth Replacement: Immediate Implant With Immediate Provisional
      Restoration. Outcome Analytics From 29 Years of Documentation.
PG  - 469-481
AB  - This article focuses on evidence-based documentation of immediate implant surgery
      with immediate provisional restoration. Since 1988 the author has documented
      14,946 implant surgical sites as to protocol, size of implant, regenerative
      regimen, outcome, and long-term follow-up. There were 8,319 immediate implant
      sites: 2,493 were immediate implant/immediate provisional restorations (IIIPR),
      and 5,826 were immediate implant/no restoration (IINR). The cumulative success
      rate of IIIPR was 95.1%, while IINR was 94.5%. Patients and dentists were
      canvassed as to outcome satisfaction of the procedure and final esthetics. The
      author concludes that IIIPR compares favorably to IINR; IIIPR were reproducible
      in diverse clinical situations, produced a steady state of bone and soft tissue
      under loading, and provided high patient satisfaction.

AB  - This study aimed to compare biomechanical characteristics of immediately loaded
      (IL) and osseointegrated (OS) dental implants inserted into Sika deer antler and 
      lay a foundation for developing an alternative animal model for dental implants
      studies. Two implants per antler were inserted. One implant was loaded
      immediately via a self-developed loading device; the other was submerged and
      unloaded as control. IL implants were harvested after different loading periods. 
      The unloaded implants were collected after OS and the shedding of antler.
      Specimens were scanned by microCT scanner and finite element models were
      generated. A vertical force of 10 N was applied on the implant. The mean values
      of maximum displacements, stresses and strains were compared. The results showed 
      that the density of antler tissue around the implants dramatically increased as
      the loading time increased. After shedding the antler, 3 pairs of antlers were
      collected and the density of antler tissue remained in a similar value in all
      specimens. The maximum values of displacement and stresses in implant and
      stresses and strains in antler tissue were significantly different among OS
      models. In one antler, all the biomechanical parameters of IL model were
      significantly higher than those of OS model of the same animal (P < 0.05) and
      wider distributions were obtained from IL model. It can be concluded that
      implants inserted into Sika deer antler might not disturb the growth and
      calcification process of antler and the use of Sika deer antler model is a
      promising alternative for implant studies that does not require animal sacrifice.

TI  - Systemic administration of strontium ranelate to enhance the osseointegration of 
      implants: systematic review of animal studies.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1186/s40729-018-0132-8 [doi]
AB  - The literature states that Strontium (Sr) is able to simultaneously stimulate
      bone formation and suppress bone resorption. Recent animal studies suggest that
      the systemic administration of Sr, in the form of strontium ranelate (SRAN),
      would enhance the osseointegration of implants. The purpose of the present study 
      was to undertake a systematic review on animal studies evaluating the systemic
      administration of Sr to enhance the osseointegration of titanium implants and the
      remodeling of bone grafts. The MEDLINE (PubMed) and Scopus bibliographic
      databases were searched from 1950 to October 2017 for reports on the use of
      systemic and non-radioactive Sr to enhance the osseointegration of titanium
      implants and the remodeling of bone grafts in animals. The search strategy was
      restricted to English language publications using the combined terms: "strontium"
      and "implant or graft or biomaterial or bone substitute". Five studies were
      included, all related to the systemic administration of Sr in the form SRAN, and 
      its effects on osseointegration of titanium implants. No studies on the use of
      SRAN-based therapy to enhance the remodeling of bone grafts were found. The
      studies differed notably with respect to the study population (healthy female
      rats, healthy male rats, and female rats with induced osteoporosis) and SRAN dose
      (ranging from 500 to 1000 mg/kg/day). Results were diverse, but a tendency
      suggesting positive influence of systemic SRAN administration on the
      osseointegration of titanium implants was observed. No major side-effects due to 
      strontium administration were reported. Systemic Sr administration, in the form
      of SRAN, seems to enhance peri-implant bone quality and implant osseointegration 
      in animals, however, at a moderate extent. Further studies, evaluating both the
      effects of this drug on implant osseointegration and the risk/benefit of its use,
      are needed to provide a rationale of this therapeutic approach.

TI  - Exposure to Ti4Al4V Titanium Alloy Leads to Redox Abnormalities, Oxidative
      Stress, and Oxidative Damage in Patients Treated for Mandible Fractures.
PG  - 3714725
LID - 10.1155/2018/3714725 [doi]
AB  - Due to the high biotolerance, favourable mechanical properties, and
      osseointegration ability, titanium is the basic biomaterial used in maxillofacial
      surgery. The passive layer of titanium dioxide on the surface of the implant
      effectively provides anticorrosive properties, but it can be damaged, resulting
      in the release of titanium ions to the surrounding tissues. The aim of our work
      was to evaluate the influence of Ti6Al4V titanium alloy on redox balance and
      oxidative damage in the periosteum surrounding the titanium miniplates and screws
      as well as in plasma and erythrocytes of patients with mandibular fractures. The 
      study included 31 previously implanted patients (aged 21-29) treated for
      mandibular fractures and 31 healthy controls. We have demonstrated increased
      activity/concentration of antioxidants both in the mandibular periosteum and
      plasma/erythrocytes of patients with titanium mandibular fixations. However,
      increased concentrations of the products of oxidative protein and lipid
      modifications were only observed in the periosteum of the study group patients.
      The correlation between the products of oxidative modification of the mandible
      and antioxidants in plasma/erythrocytes suggests a relationship between the
      increase of oxidative damage at the implantation site and central redox disorders
      in patients with titanium miniplates and screws.

AB  - The optimization of loading protocols following dental implant insertion requires
      setting up patient-specific protocols, customized according to the actual implant
      osseointegration, measured through quantitative, objective methods. Various
      devices for the assessment of implant stability as an indirect measure of implant
      osseointegration have been developed. They are analyzed here, introducing the
      respective physical models, outlining major advantages and critical aspects, and 
      reporting their clinical performance. A careful discussion of underlying
      hypotheses is finally reported, as is a suggestion for further development of
      instrumentation and signal analysis.

      scanning electron microscopy studies on a rabbit model.
PG  - 107-113
LID - 10.5603/FM.a2018.0055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern joint arthroplasties rely on osseointegration of metal
      components through bone ingrowth into hydroxyapatite (HA) layers. However, such
      surfaces are prone to colonisation by bacteria and formation of biofilms.
      Application of silver nanoparticles (SNs) to hydroxyapatite coatings could reduce
      the risk of infection; however, little is known about how this would affect the
      process of bone ingrowth. This study examined osseointegration of conventional
      and SN doped HA coatings in a rabbit model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study,
      12 cylindrical implants coated with conven- tional and SN doped HA were implanted
      into New Zealand white rabbit femora, with each animal receiving both types of
      implants. After 12 weeks, rabbits were sacrificed, their femora were harvested
      and implants removed during pull-out testing. Retrieved samples were dehydrated, 
      sputter coated and observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to verify 
      bony ingrowth and retention of SNs. RESULTS: The percentage of implant in direct 
      contact with bone was measured in cross-sections of implants. The SEM analysis
      demonstrated that osseointegration of the SN doped coatings was similar to the
      conventional HA samples. A similar morphology of newly formed trabecular bone was
      observed in both implants, with silver doped HA-coated implants retaining
      multiple nanoparticles in areas which were not overgrown by bone. Analysis of the
      bone-implant contact area revealed comparable results for both types of coatings.
      These finding indicated that SN doped HA coatings are characterised by good
      osseointegrative properties. CONCLUSIONS: Since SNs were found in areas not
      covered by mineralised bone, it is assumed that the antimicrobial properties of
      the modified coating may be retained for 12 weeks after implantation. Additional 
      studies are required to fine--tune the composition of HA coatings with SNs, to
      ensure optimal osseointegrative and antimicrobial properties.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a
      biologically active dental implant surface (treated with sandblasting and acid
      etching [SLA] followed by immersion in simulated body fluid [SBF]) on
      osseointegration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We randomly divided 9 healthy adult male
      beagles (aged 8 months; body weight, 12 kg) into 3 groups: machined, SLA, and
      SLA-biomineralization (SLA-Bio). Six pure titanium implants (diameter of 3.5 mm
      and length of 8 mm) were used in the mandible of each dog after observation of
      the surface morphology, as well as analysis of the composition of the surface
      elements by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. At
      4, 8, and 12 weeks after implantation, animals were euthanized to collect the
      mandibles so that we could perform the removal torque test to evaluate the
      implant stability in bone and histomorphometry to analyze the implant-bone
      osseointegration. RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy results showed that
      uniformly distributed sponge-like structures were found on the SLA-treated
      surface and an apatite layer was observed on the SLA-SBF-treated surface (SLA-Bio
      group). In the energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analysis, the elements
      titanium, oxygen, carbon, calcium, and phosphorus were found on the surfaces of
      the SLA-Bio group, whereas titanium was the only element found in the other
      groups. The removal torque test showed that the peak removal torque values of the
      3 groups increased gradually with the passage of time, and the peak removal
      torque values of the SLA-Bio group were significantly higher than those of the
      other groups (P < .01) at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after implantation.
      Histomorphometric analysis showed that osseointegration was being enabled more
      rapidly in the SLA-Bio group, as well as that the mineral apposition rate and
      percentage of bone-to-implant contact of the SLA-Bio group were higher than those
      of the remaining groups at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after implantation (P < .01).
      CONCLUSIONS: Treating titanium implants with SLA-SBF can improve osseointegration
      as well as increase the interfacial shear strength.

AB  - Bone defects/fractures are common in older people suffering from osteoporosis.
      Traditional hydroxyapatite (HA) materials for osteoporotic bone repair face many 
      challenges, including limited bone formation and aseptic loosening of orthopedic 
      implants. In this study, a new multifunctional HA is synthesized by spontaneous
      assembly of alendronate (AL) and Fe3O4 onto HA nanocrystals for osteoporotic bone
      regeneration. The chemical coordination of AL and Fe3O4 with HA does not induce
      lattice deformation, resulting in a functionalized HA (Func-HA) with proper
      magnetic property and controlled release manner. The Func-HA nanocrystals have
      been encapsulated in polymer substrates to further investigate their osteogenic
      capability. In vitro and in vivo evaluations reveal that both AL and Fe3O4,
      especially the combination of two functional groups on HA, can inhibit
      osteoclastic activity and promote osteoblast proliferation and differentiation,
      as well as enhance implant osseointegration and accelerate bone remodeling under 
      osteoporotic condition. The as-developed Func-HA with coordinating antiresorptive
      ability, magnetic property, and osteoconductivity might be a desirable
      biomaterial for osteoporotic bone defect/fracture treatment.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to assess hard and soft tissue around
      dental implants made of three different materials with microgrooves on the collar
      surface. Microgrooved implants were inserted in the mandibles of five male
      beagles. Implants were made of three kinds of material; titanium (Ti),
      yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (Y-TZP) and ceria partially
      stabilized zirconia/alumina nanocomposite (Ce-TZP/Al2O3). The animals were
      euthanatized at three months after implantation, and harvested tissue was
      analyzed by means of histology. All kinds of implant were osseointegrated, and
      there were no significant differences in any histomorphometric parameters among
      the three groups of microgrooved implants made of different materials. Within the
      limitations of this study, implants with microgrooves integrated into the
      surrounding bone tissue, without statistically significant differences among the 
      three tested materials, Ti, Y-TZP, and Ce-TZP/Al2O3.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment has a favorable 
      effect on implant osseointegration in diabetic rabbits. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An 
      experimental diabetes model was induced in 32 New Zealand rabbits through IV
      injection of alloxan. After the state of diabetes had been confirmed, one dental 
      implant was placed in the metaphysical region of each animal's tibia. After the
      implants' placements, the animals were divided into two groups. Half of the
      animals underwent HBO treatment, while the other group did not receive HBO
      treatment and served as the control group. The animals were euthanized at the 4th
      and 8th weeks. The osseointegration of the implants were compared by
      histomorphometry and resonance frequency analysis (RFA). RESULTS: The Bone
      Implant Contact (BIC) values were significantly higher in the HBO group than in
      the control group at the 4th week. There was no difference in the BIC values
      between the groups at the 8th week. There was no significant difference in the
      RFA scores between the groups both at the 4th and 8th weeks after the operation. 
      CONCLUSION: Histomorphometry findings suggest that HBO has positive effect on
      implant osseointegration in the early healing period in diabetic rabbits.
      However, implant stability is not affected by HBO treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The hypothesis of this study was that the peri-implant bone healing
      of the group of pinealectomized rats would differ from the control group. The
      samples were subjected to immunohistochemical, microtomographic (total porosity
      and connectivity density), and fluorochrome (mineralized surface) analyses.
      OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to investigate the cellular changes and
      bone remodeling dynamics along the bone/implant interface in pinealectomized
      rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The total of 18 adult male rats (Rattus norvegicus
      albinus, Wistar) was divided into three groups (n=6): control (CO),
      pinealectomized without melatonin (PNX) and pinealectomized with melatonin
      (PNXm). All animals were submitted to the first surgery (pinealectomy), except
      the CO group. Thirty days after the pinealectomy without melatonin, the second
      surgery was conducted, in which all animals received an implant in each tibia (36
      titanium implants with surface treatment were installed - Implalife(R) Sao Paulo,
      SP, Brazil). By gavage, the rats of the PNX group received the vehicle solution, 
      and the procedure. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis for runt-related
      transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin (OP) and 
      osteocalcin (OC) showed that the bone repair process in the PNXm group was
      similar to that of the CO group, whereas the PNX group showed a delay. The
      microtomographic parameters of total porosity [Po(tot)] and bone surface (BS)
      showed no statistically significant differences, whereas for the connective
      density (Conn.Dn) a statistical difference was found between the CO and PNXm
      groups. Fluorochrome analysis of the active mineralized surface showed
      statistically significant difference between the CO and PNX and between the CO
      and PNXm groups. CONCLUSION: The absence of the pineal gland impaired the bone
      repair process during osseointegration, however the daily melatonin replacement
      was able to restore this response.

AB  - To evaluate peri-implant bone loss (PIBL) and stability around submerged and
      non-submerged dental implants in patients with and without type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM). Thirty-five T2DM and non-diabetic (NT2DM) patients were included
      in this study. Demographic data were recorded using a questionnaire and PIBL was 
      measured on digital radiographs. Resonance frequency analysis (RFA) was carried
      out for each implant at the time of fixture placement and at 3 months in both
      groups. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. One
      hundred and eighteen dental implants with a mean height of 10 to 12 mm and 3.3 to
      4.1 mm in diameter were placed. The comparison of the mean RFA values at baseline
      and at 3 months was statistically significant (p = 0.008) in T2DM patients. The
      inter-group mean RFA values at baseline and at 3 months were not significant (p >
      0.05). PIBL was significantly high in T2DM as compared to NT2DM patients at each 
      follow-up (p < 0.05). At 2, 3, and 7 years, non-submerged dental implants showed 
      significantly high PIBL in T2DM patients as compared to NT2DM individuals
      (p<0.05). The results of the present clinical study demonstrate increased PIBL
      around non-submerged single-tooth implant-supported restorations in T2DM
      patients, which may be due to the immune inflammatory status.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This work aims to investigate the effect of porous tantalum and porous
      titanium on osseointegration. METHODS: Two kinds of porous materials with same
      microporous parameters, namely, porous tantalum and porous titanium, were
      fabricated by computer-aided design (CAD) modeling and 3D printing technology. A 
      defect model was established in 24 New Zealand white rabbits in the bilateral
      femoral lateral malleolus at the left and right side of each animal. Then,
      animals were randomly divided into two groups, and bone defects were repaired by 
      porous tantalum and porous titanium (experimental and control groups,
      respectively). Animals were sacrificed at two, four, and eight weeks after
      implantation. Gross observation and methylene blue-acid fuchsin staining were
      used to observe osseointegration of the implant and bone interface, and the
      osseointegration strength of implant bone interface was tested by push-out test. 
      RESULTS: At two, four, and eight weeks after operation, the new bone tissue in
      the two groups increased gradually, and new bone trabecula appeared and grew into
      the pores of the materials. No significant difference (P>0.05) in osteogenesis
      and the strength of implant bone tissue interface between the two groups was
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: 3Dprinted porous tantalum implants, which exhibit
      comparable osseointegration capabilities to porous titanium implants, can form an
      early biological combination with bone tissue.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to validate an experimental model
      for assessing tissue integration of titanium and zirconia implants with and
      without buccal dehiscence defects. Methods: In 3 dogs, 5 implants were randomly
      placed on both sides of the mandibles: 1) Z1: a zirconia implant (modified
      surface) within the bony housing, 2) Z2: a zirconia implant (standard surface)
      within the bony housing, 3) T: a titanium implant within the bony housing, 4)
      Z1_D: a Z1 implant placed with a buccal bone dehiscence defect (3 mm), and 5)
      T_D: a titanium implant placed with a buccal bone dehiscence defect (3 mm). The
      healing times were 2 weeks (one side of the mandible) and 6 weeks (the opposite
      side). Results: The dimensions of the peri-implant soft tissue varied depending
      on the implant and the healing time. The level of the mucosal margin was located 
      more apically at 6 weeks than at 2 weeks in all groups, except group T. The
      presence of a buccal dehiscence defect did not result in a decrease in the
      overall soft tissue dimensions between 2 and 6 weeks (4.80+/-1.31 and 4.3 mm in
      group Z1_D, and 4.47+/-1.06 and 4.5+/-1.37 mm in group T_D, respectively). The
      bone-to-implant contact (BIC) values were highest in group Z1 at both time points
      (34.15%+/-21.23% at 2 weeks, 84.08%+/-1.33% at 6 weeks). The buccal dehiscence
      defects in groups Z1_D and T_D showed no further bone loss at 6 weeks compared to
      2 weeks. Conclusions: The modified surface of Z1 demonstrated higher BIC values
      than the surface of Z2. There were minimal differences in the mucosal margin
      between 2 and 6 weeks in the presence of a dehiscence defect. The present model
      can serve as a useful tool for studying peri-implant dehiscence defects at the
      hard and soft tissue levels.

      hierarchical micro-/nanorod topography optimized for osseointegration.
PG  - 3643-3659
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S159989 [doi]
AB  - Background: Optimal osseointegration has been recognized as a pivotal factor in
      determining the long-term success of biomedical implants. Materials and methods: 
      In the current study, highly carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA) with carbonate
      contents of 8, 12 and 16 wt% and pure hydroxyapatite (HA) were fabricated via a
      novel hydrothermal method and deposited on the titanium substrates to generate
      corresponding CHA bioceramic coatings (designated as C8, C12 and C16,
      respectively) and HA bioceramic coatings (designated as C0). Results: C8, C12 and
      C16 were endowed with nanoscale, hierarchical hybrid micro-/nanoscale and
      microscale surface topographies with rod-like superstructures, respectively.
      Compared with C0, the micro-/nanotextured CHA bioceramic coatings (C8, C12 and
      C16) possessed excellent surface bioactivity and biocompatibility, as well as
      better wettability, which mediated improved protein adsorption, giving rise to
      simultaneous enhancement of a biological cascade of events of rat
      bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells including cell adhesion,
      proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and, notably, the production of the
      pro-angiogenic growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor-A. In
      particular, C12 with biomimetic hierarchical hybrid micro-/nanorod topography
      exhibited superior fractal property and predominant performance of protein
      adsorption, cell adhesion, proliferation and osteogenesis concomitant with
      angiogenesis. Conclusion: All these results suggest that the 12 wt% CHA
      bioceramic coating with synergistic modification of surface chemistry and
      topography has great prospect for future use as implant coating to achieve
      optimum osseointegration for orthopedic and dental applications.

AB  - Wear-mediated osteolysis is a common complication occurring around implanted
      prosthesis, which ultimately leads to bone loss with mechanical instability and
      the need for surgical revision. At the moment, revision surgery is the only
      effective treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of pulsed
      electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) and platelet rich plasma (PRP), alone and in
      association, in a clinically relevant in vivo model of periprosthetic osteolysis.
      Titanium alloy pins were implanted intramedullary in distal femurs of male inbred
      rats and, after osseointegration, polyethylene particles were injected
      intra-articularly to induce osteolysis. Animals were divided in four groups of
      treatment: PEMFs, PRP, PEMFs+PRP and no treatment. Microtomography was performed 
      during the course of experiments to monitor bone stock and microarchitecture.
      Histology, histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry and biomechanics were evaluated
      after treatments. Biophysical and biological stimulations significantly enhanced 
      bone to implant contact, bone volume and bone microhardness and reduced fibrous
      capsule formation and the number of osteoclasts around implants. Among
      treatments, PEMFs alone and in association with PRP exerted better results than
      PRP alone. Present data suggest that biophysical stimulation, with or without the
      enrichment with platelet derived growth factors, might be a safe, mini-invasive
      and conservative therapy for counteracting osteolysis and prompting bone
      formation around implants. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Pulsed electromagnetic
      fields (PEMFs) and platelet rich plasma (PRP) show anabolic and anti-inflammatory
      effects and they are already been used in clinical practice, but separately. To
      date, there are no preclinical in vivo studies evaluating their combined efficacy
      in periprosthetic osteolysis, in bone tissue microarchitecture and in
      biomechanics. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of PEMFs
      and PRP in vivo, when administered individually and in combination in the
      treatment of periprosthetic wear mediated ostelysis, and in restoring the
      osteogenetic properties of perimplant bone tissue and its biomechanical
      competence. The combination of PEMFs and PRP could be employed for counteracting 
      the ostelysis process in a conservative and non surgical manner.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effects of zirconia micro coating on the
      proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts on the surface of zirconia
      ceramic, and to provide a strategy for zirconia implant surface treatment.
      Methods: Forty tablets of zirconia ceramic, with the diameter of 15 mm and the
      thickness of 1.5 mm, were prepared. Then, twenty tablets polished by water
      sandpaper were taken as the control group, and 20 pieces of the zirconia coating 
      after sintering micron were taken as the experimental group. The micromorphology 
      of the surface of the two groups were observed by scanning electron microscope.
      The cell morphology after inoculation with MC3T3-E1 of osteoblasts on the surface
      of the material was investigated for 1, 3, and 5 days by scanning electron
      microscope. The cell proliferation was detected at 1 and 3 days by methyl
      thiazolyl tetrazolium. The cell differentiation ability was detected at 3 and 7
      days by real-time quantitative PCR. Statistical analysis was conducted by
      independent sample t test. Results: After coating with zirconia micron particles,
      pores with the diameter of 1-20 mum could be observed on the surface of the test 
      group of tiles through high temperature sintering. The growth of osteoblasts on
      the surface of the ceramic chip in the test group and control group exhibited the
      similar cell morphology. As they were cultured for 1 day, the experimental group 
      exhibited a similar quality of cells as those in the test group (P>0.05). After 3
      days' incubation, comparing with the cell quality of the test group (1.067 +/-
      0.077) (P<0.05), the quality of osteoblasts on the surface of zirconia ceramics
      coating increased to 1.763+/-0.165, and the expression of mRNA in alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP), osteopotin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN) also increased with the
      amount of 1.63+/-0.28, 1.99+/-0.41 and 1.60+/-0.30, respectively, compared with
      the test group (1.00+/- 0.00) (P<0.05). Seven days later, the expression of mRNA 
      in Runt-related transcription factor-2 (RNUX2) (1.33+/-0.19), special AT-rich
      sequence binding protein-2 (SATB2) (1.64 +/- 0.36), as well as alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP) (1.78+/-0.40), OPN (2.25+/-0.36), and OCN (1.88+/-0.21), showed
      a remarkably increase compared with the test group (1.00+/-0.00) (P<0.05).
      Conclusions: Zirconia micro coating on the surface of zirconia ceramics promoted 
      the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts adhered.

AB  - Although many studies have focused on how material surface modifications can
      promote stem cell differentiation toward osteogenic osteoblasts, little is known 
      about the reaction between material surface and other cells, including
      osteoclasts and foreign body giant cells. Dental implant osseointegration results
      from the functional coupling and equilibrium not only between osteoblasts and
      osteoclasts but also between bone tissue and immune system. Osteoclasts and
      foreign body giant cells share the same origin, monocyte/macrophage lineage
      cells, which have initially got concerns in the field of implant osseointegration
      with regard to their peri-implant distribution and biological functions.
      Up-to-date data has shown that cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage origin
      manifest key roles in the establishment of peri-implant osseointegration and the 
      long-term maintenance of marginal bone level and the prevalence of
      peri-implantitis. However, preliminary progress has been made in the subtypes,
      phenotypes vs. genotypes, and functions of monocyte/macrophage-lineage-originated
      cells on the osseointegration interface, quite a lot of facts still remain
      unclear, especially the potential and the rapeutic targets which could coordinate
      the cellular peri-implant microenvironment and the implant osseointegrated
      interface in the short and long term. This review will focus on the current
      progress in the function of monocyte/macrophage-lineage origin cells on the
      peri-implant osseointegration interface.

AB  - During the past three decades, the technology of implant surface modification has
      already formed well-developed methods including physical and chemical means.
      However, titanium is a kind of bioinert material, which will directly result in
      slowly bone-bond with bone tissue after implantation and ultimately reduce the
      success rate of dental implant surgery. Therefore, the introduction of bioactive 
      substances which can effectively regulate and promote the proliferation of bone
      cells to modify the titanium implant surface has received tremendous attention in
      the research of oral implant field. The research of biological modification
      starts relatively late and it has not formed well-established system yet. The
      research progress is given in this paper concerning the bioactivators and methods
      used in biological modification. Furthermore, the current situation as well as
      the recent developments involving the biological modification of dental implant
      are also discussed in this review.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of ultraviolet
      (UV) photofunctionalization of dental titanium implants with exposure to the oral
      cavity on osseointegration in an animal model. METHODS: Forty-eight titanium
      implants (Camlog((R)) Conelog((R)) 4.3 mmx9.0 mm) were placed epicrestally into
      the edentulous jaws of three minipigs and implant stability was assessed by
      measuring the implant stability quotient (ISQ). Prior to implantation half of the
      implants were photofunctionalized with intense UV-light. After three months, the 
      implants were exposed and ISQ was measured again. After six months of implant
      exposure, the minipigs were sacrificed and the harvested specimens were analyzed 
      using histomorphometric, light, and fluorescence microscopy. MAIN RESULTS:
      Forty-two of 48 implants osseointegrated. The overall mean bone-implant contact
      area (BIC) was (64+/-22)%. No significant differences were found in BIC or ISQ
      value (multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), P>0.05) between implants with 
      and without exposure to UV photofunctionalization. CONCLUSIONS: No significant
      effects were observed on osseointegration of dental titanium implants nine months
      after exposure of UV photofunctionalization.

AB  - Survival, differentiation capability, and activity of cells are strictly related 
      to structural features and the composition of the extracellular matrix, and its
      variation affects tissue homeostasis. Placement of a dental implant in bone
      tissue activates a sequence of molecular and cellular events that lead to the
      apposition of newly-formed bone directly onto the titanium surface. Due to
      implant's interaction with the mineralized tissue, osseointegration is affected
      by the surface structure of the implanted material. Surface nanotopography and
      microtopography can modify the shape and activity of mesenchymal stem cells
      leading to a higher differentiation rate of these cells into osteogenic lineage
      with the upregulation of osteoblastic genes. Several approaches for implant
      surface modification are currently under investigation or have been recently
      proposed to improve osseointegration. Most surface treatments are aimed at the
      formation of a thick layer of titanium oxide, at the alteration of surface
      chemical composition by incorporating bioactive molecules and drugs, and at the
      creation of a surface topography that is more attractive for osteoblast
      differentiation, adhesion, and osteogenic activity. Data on the
      cellular-substrate interaction, as well as in vivo studies assessing the response
      to these novel surfaces, are reviewed in the present study. The application of
      modern surfaces in dental clinical practice might increase and accelerate implant
      osseointegration, but could also reduce the occurrence of peri-implant bone loss 
      and favor the re-osseointegration of an affected surface.

TI  - Human osteoblasts exhibit sexual dimorphism in their response to estrogen on
      microstructured titanium surfaces.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osseointegration is dependent on the implant surface, surrounding
      bone quality, and the systemic host environment, which can differ in male and
      female patients. Titanium (Ti) implants with microstructured surfaces exhibit
      greater pullout strength when compared to smooth-surfaced implants and exhibit
      enhanced osteogenic cellular responses in vitro. Previous studies showed that
      1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha,25(OH)2D3] has a greater effect on rat
      osteoblast differentiation on microstructured Ti compared to smooth Ti surfaces
      and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). The stimulatory effect of 17beta-estradiol
      (E2) on differentiation is observed in female osteoblasts on micro-rough Ti, but 
      it is not known if male osteoblasts behave similarly in response to E2 and
      microtopography. This study assessed whether human male and female osteoblasts
      exhibit sex-specific differences in response to E2 and 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 when
      cultured on microstructured Ti surfaces. METHODS: Osteoblasts from three male and
      three female human donors were cultured on Ti discs with varying surface
      profiles: a smooth pretreatment (PT), a coarse grit-blasted/acid-etched (SLA),
      and an SLA surface having undergone modification in a nitrogen environment and
      stored in saline to maintain hydrophilicity (modSLA). Cells cultured on these
      surfaces were treated with E2 or 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. RESULTS: Male and female human
      osteoblasts responded similarly to microstructure although there were
      donor-specific differences; cell number decreased, and osteocalcin (OCN),
      osteoprotegerin (OPG), and latent and active transforming growth factor 1
      increased on SLA and modSLA compared to TCPS. Female osteoblasts had higher
      alkaline phosphatase activity and OCN production than male counterparts but
      produced less OPG. Both sexes responded similarly to 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. E2
      treatment reduced cell number and increased osteoblast differentiation and factor
      production only in female cells. CONCLUSIONS: Male and female human osteoblasts
      respond similarly to microstructure and 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 but exhibit sexual
      dimorphism in substrate-dependent responses to E2. E2 affected female
      osteoblasts, suggesting that signaling is sex-specific and surface-dependent.
      Donor osteoblasts varied in response, demonstrating the need to test multiple
      donors when examining human samples. Understanding how male and female cells
      respond to orthopedic biomaterials will enable greater predictability
      post-implantation as well as therapies that are more patient-specific.

PG  - 1504-1515
LID - 10.1080/10717544.2018.1477855 [doi]
AB  - Along with the development of nanotechnological strategies for biomaterials
      associated with the prevention of infections, a myriad of clinically unproven
      techniques have been described to date. In this work, the aim was to perform a
      critical analysis of the literature available concerning antibacterial
      biomaterials for oral implantology and to provide a practical derivation for such
      a purpose. As anti-adhesive strategies may affect osseointegration, they should
      no longer be recommended for inclusion in this class of biomaterials, despite
      promising results in biomedical engineering for other, non-bone load bearing
      organs. Targeted, antibacterial drug delivery is most likely desirable in the
      case of intraosseous implants. Interfering factors such as the oral cavity
      environment, saliva, the bacterial microbiome, as well as, the characteristics of
      the alveolar mucosa and peri-implant space must be taken into account when
      calculating the local pharmacokinetics for antibacterial coatings. Effective
      release is crucial for tailoring antibacterial implant longevity providing
      minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the desired amount of time, which for 
      oral implants, should be at least the cumulative time for the osseointegration
      period and functional loading period within the tissues. These parameters may
      differ between the implant type and its anatomical site. Also, the functional
      drug concentration in the peri-implant space should be calculated as the amount
      of the drug released from the implant surface including the concentration of the 
      drug inactivated by biological fluids of the peri-implant space or saliva flow
      throughout the effective release time.

AB  - In the present study, a model for simulations of removal torque experiments was
      developed using finite element method. The interfacial retention and fracturing
      of the surrounding material caused by the surface features during torque was
      analyzed. It was hypothesized that the progression of removal torque and the
      phases identified in the torque response plot represents sequential fractures at 
      the interface. The 3-dimensional finite element model fairly accurately predicts 
      the torque required to break the fixation of acid-etched implants, and also
      provides insight to how sequential fractures progress downwards along the implant
      side.

AB  - The decreased bone mass and impaired osteogenesis capacities that occur with
      aging may influence the outcome of dental implants. Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
      (1-34) is an anabolic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis. However, little is
      known about its effects and mechanisms on vascularized bone regeneration and
      implant osseointegration in aging. In current study, we adopted both in vivo and 
      in vitro approaches to explore the mechanisms of early actions of PTH (1-34) on
      the angiogenic and osteogenic microenvironment to enhance implant
      osseointegration in aged rats. Daily subcutaneous injections of 30mug/kg PTH
      (1-34) were given to female rats aged 20 months beginning on next day of
      implantation and lasting for 5 weeks. Radiological and histological analysis
      confirmed that PTH (1-34) improved new bone formation, angiogenesis and implant
      osseointegration in aged rats in the early stage. The osteogenic potential of
      aged bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) was enhanced, while their adipogenesis
      capacity was attenuated. Furthermore, PTH (1-34) was shown to promote
      angiogenesis directly via endothelial cell migration and blood vessel formation
      in vitro. Meanwhile, PTH (1-34) stimulated more osteoclasts participation in bone
      remodeling by secreting angiogenic and osteogenic growth factors to induce early 
      vascularization and stimulate the migration or differentiation of BMSCs
      indirectly. Together, these results demonstrate mechanistic insight into how PTH 
      (1-34) regulates the angiogenic and osteogenic microenvironment to result in more
      active bone remodeling and new bone formation, making it an excellent potential
      therapeutic agent for rapid vascularized bone regeneration and implant
      osseointegration in the aged population.

TI  - Osteotome Sinus Floor Elevation Without Grafting: A 10-Year Clinical and
      Cone-Beam Sinus Assessment.
PG  - 439-444

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the thickness of the sinus membrane in contact with implants
      inserted 10 years before using an augmentation procedure without grafting
      material, and to identify adverse events correlated with implant protrusion in
      the sinus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Osteotome sinus floor elevations were performed
      without grafting material. The implants (Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland) were
      placed simultaneously, all protruded into the sinus. After 10 years, implants
      were considered viable in the absence of mobility, pain, infection, or continued 
      radiolucency. Sinus health was assessed using cone-beam computed tomography and
      by the way of a questionnaire in which patients reported symptoms of sinusitis
      they might have had. RESULTS: Controlled implants (21 implants, 13 patients) were
      osseointegrated. The membrane thickness was <2 mm in 11 patients and 2 to 3 mm
      with flat thickening in 2 patients. No patients exhibited any clinical or
      radiographic signs of sinusitis. CONCLUSIONS: No sinus complications were
      observed after 10 years. The initial protrusion of implants into the sinus did
      not influence long-term sinus health. The maintenance of successful integration
      is thus the key to avoiding sinus complication.

TI  - Endo-sinus bone formation after transalveolar sinus floor elevation without
      grafting with simultaneous implant placement: Histological and histomorphometric 
      assessment in a dog model.
PG  - 1118-1127
LID - 10.1111/jcpe.12975 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate endo-sinus new bone formation and implant osseointegration after
      transalveolar sinus floor elevation (TSFE) and simultaneous implant placement
      without any grafting materials and to investigate the influence of implant
      surface modification on bone healing process under this circumstance. MATERIALS
      AND METHODS: Transalveolar sinus floor elevation and simultaneous implant
      placement were conducted bilaterally on 12 Labrador dogs. No grafting materials
      were used during surgery. Implants with two different surfaces (SLA and SLActive)
      were placed in a split-mouth design. The animals were sacrificed 4, 8 and 24
      weeks after surgery for histological and histomorphometric assessments.
      Bone-to-implant contact (BIC%), alveolar bone height (ABH) and the percentages of
      mineralized bone (MB%) in the area of interest were analysed. The probing depth
      (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP) were also assessed to describe peri-implant
      health conditions. RESULTS: Sprouts of new bone in direct contact with implant
      surface were seen in the elevated area at every time point. Newly formed woven
      bone under sinus membrane was visible. SLActive implants exhibited favourable
      results compared with SLA implants regarding ABH at 4 weeks and BIC% at 4 and 8
      weeks. Sites with BOP positive could be observed in both groups at any time
      point. No newly formed bone can be found on the implant apex with either SLA or
      SLActive surfaces at any time point. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous new bone formation 
      from the parent bone walls could be observed after TFE without any grafting
      materials. No clear evidence of bone formation from the Schneiderian membrane
      could be found. Even though there were trends for quicker bone response of
      SLActive implants, this study failed to show the absolute advantage of SLActive
      in achieving endo-sinus bone formation.

AB  - Over the last two decades, several conservative femoral prostheses have been
      designed. The goals of conservative stems include: the spearing of the
      trochanteric bone stock; a more physiological loading in the proximal femur
      reducing the risk of stress shielding; and to avoid a long stem into the
      diaphysis preventing impingement with the femoral cortex and thigh pain.All stems
      designed to be less invasive than conventional uncemented stems are commonly
      named 'short stems'. However, this term is misleading because it refers to a
      heterogeneous group of stems deeply different in terms of design, biomechanics
      and bearing. In the short-term follow-up, all conservative stems provided
      excellent survivorship. However, variable rates of complications were reported,
      including stem malalignment, incorrect stem sizing and intra-operative
      fracture.Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) studies demonstrated that some
      conservative stems were affected by an early slight migration and rotation within
      the first months after surgery, followed by a secondary stable fixation.
      Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) studies demonstrated an implant-specific 
      pattern of bone remodelling.Although the vast majority of stems demonstrated a
      good osseointegration, some prostheses transferred loads particularly to the
      lateral and distal-medial regions, favouring proximal stress shielding and bone
      atrophy in the great trochanter and calcar regions. Cite this article: EFORT Open

TI  - Unravelling the effect of macro and microscopic design of dental implants on
      osseointegration: a randomised clinical study in minipigs.
PG  - 99
LID - 10.1007/s10856-018-6101-1 [doi]
AB  - Several dental implants are commercially available and new prototype design are
      constantly being fabricated. Nevertheless, it is still unclear what parameters of
      the design affect most the osseointegration of dental implants. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the effects of the microscopic and macroscopic design of 
      dental implants in the osseointegration by comparing three macroscopic designs
      (Straumann tissue level (STD), essential cone (ECD) and prototype design (PD))
      and six surface treatments. A total of 96 implants were placed in 12 minipigs.
      The implant stability quotient (ISQ), was assessed at the time of implantation,
      as well as at 2, 4 and 8 weeks. Histomorphometric and statistical analyses were
      conducted at the different sacrifice times, being 2, 4 and 8 weeks, to analyse
      the bone to implant contact (BIC), the bone area density (BAT) and the density of
      bone outside the thread region (ROI). The macroscopic design results showed
      higher ISQ values for the ECD, whereas the histomorphometric analysis showed
      higher ossoeintegration values for the STD. Regarding the microscopic design,
      both Sandblasted plus acid etching (hydrochloric/sulphuric acid) in a nitrogen
      atmosphere (SLActive) and Shot-blasted or bombarded with alumina particles and
      posterior alkaline immersion and thermal treatment (ContacTi) showed superior
      results in terms of osseointegration and reduced the osseointegration times from 
      8 weeks to 4 weeks compared to the other analysed surfaces. In conclusion, each
      of the macroscopic and microscopic designs need to be taken into account when
      designing novel dental implants to enhance the osseointegration process.

AB  - The nanotechnology field plays an important role in the improvement of dental
      implant surfaces. However, the different techniques used to coat these implants
      with nanostructured materials can differently affect cells, biomolecules and even
      ions at the nano scale level. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare
      the structural, biomechanical and histological characterization of nano titania
      films produced by either modified laser or dip coating techniques on commercially
      pure titanium implant fixtures. Grade II commercially pure titanium rectangular
      samples measuring 35 x 12 x 0.25 mm length, width and thickness, respectively
      were coated with titania films using a modified laser deposition technique as the
      experimental group, while the control group was dip-coated with titania film. The
      crystallinity, surface roughness, histological feature, microstructures and
      removal torque values were investigated and compared between the groups. Compared
      with dip coating technique, the modified laser technique provided a higher
      quality thin coating film, with improved surface roughness values. For in vivo
      examinations, forty coated screw-designed dental implants were inserted into the 
      tibia of 20 white New Zealand rabbits' bone. Biomechanical and histological
      evaluations were performed after 2 and 4 weeks of implantation. The histological 
      findings showed a variation in the bone response around coated implants done with
      different coating techniques and different healing intervals. Modified
      laser-coated samples revealed a significant improvement in structure, surface
      roughness values, bone integration and bond strength at the bone-implant
      interface than dip-coated samples. Thus, this technique can be an alternative for
      coating titanium dental implants.

      versus without plasma rich in growth factor: A comparison.
PG  - 39-47
LID - 10.4103/njms.NJMS_74_17 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The placement of implants into fresh extraction sockets was
      introduced in 1970. This approach has been reviewed extensively during the past
      decade. Immediate postextraction implant placement is a well-accepted protocol.
      The concept of placement of dental implants soon after the removal of a tooth in 
      smokers, however, is still a matter of controversy. Purpose: (i) To access
      failure rate of dental implant in smokers (ii) To evaluate added advantage of
      plasma rich in growth factors (PRGFs) in immediate placement of dental implants
      in smokers. Materials and Methods: The sample of 30 patients was obtained from
      the different Outpatient Department of Faculty of Dental Sciences; King George's 
      Medical University, Lucknow, who had visited for rehabilitation of missing teeth 
      by implants between April 2013 and July 2015. They were randomly divided into two
      groups (without use of PRGF and with use of PRGF) of 15 each. Pre- and
      postoperative assessment included a thorough history and clinical examination,
      regression of pain and swelling, implant stability by resonance frequency
      analysis (RFA), and implant stability according to the bone type as well as
      radiographic interpretation for measurement of bone loss on the mesial and distal
      surfaces of the implant. Results: In this study, pain and swelling were
      significantly (P < 0.05) higher in Group A than in Group B across the time
      interval. RFA score for implant stability was lower in Group A across the period 
      than Group B. At the end of 3 months, RFA score (mean) in Group A was having
      72.55 ISQ value, and in Group B, it was 75.71 ISQ value. In this study,
      postoperative crestal bone loss was more in patients in Group A as compared to
      patients in Group B. There was significant difference in mesial (P = 0.003) and
      distal (P = 0.001) crestal bone loss at 6 months between the groups. Conclusion: 
      The immediate placement of dental implants in smokers with use of PRGF is shown
      to be efficient in relation to postoperative pain and swelling, stability,
      stability according to bone type, as well as bone loss.

TI  - The etiology of hard- and soft-tissue deficiencies at dental implants: A
      narrative review.
PG  - S291-S303
LID - 10.1002/JPER.16-0810 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present paper was to review factors and
      conditions that are associated with hard and soft-tissue deficiencies at implant 
      sites. IMPORTANCE: Hard- and soft-tissue deficiencies at dental implants are
      common clinical findings. They can lead to complications and compromise implant
      survival and, hence, may require therapeutic interventions. It is, therefore,
      important to understand the etiology of hard and soft-tissue deficiencies. Based 
      on this understanding, strategies should be developed to correct hard and
      soft-tissue deficiencies with the aim of improving clinical outcomes of implant
      therapy. FINDINGS: A large number of etiological factors have been identified
      that may lead to hard and soft-tissue deficiencies. These factors include: 1)
      systemic diseases and conditions of the patients; 2) systemic medications; 3)
      processes of tissue healing; 4) tissue turnover and tissue response to clinical
      interventions; 5) trauma to orofacial structures; 6) local diseases affecting the
      teeth, the periodontium, the bone and the mucosa; 7) biomechanical factors; 8)
      tissue morphology and tissue phenotype; and 9) iatrogenic factors. These factors 
      may appear as an isolated cause of hard and soft-tissue defects or may appear in 
      conjunction with other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Hard- and soft-tissue deficiencies
      at implant sites may result from a multitude of factors. They encompass natural
      resorption processes following tooth extraction, trauma, infectious diseases such
      as periodontitis, peri-implantitis, endodontic infections, growth and
      development, expansion of the sinus floor, anatomical preconditions, mechanical
      overload, thin soft tissues, lack of keratinized mucosa, malpositioning of
      implants, migration of teeth, lifelong growth, and systemic diseases. When more
      than one factor leading to hard and/or soft-tissue deficiencies appear together, 
      the severity of the resulting condition may increase. Efforts should be made to
      better identify the relative importance of these etiological factors, and to
      develop strategies to counteract their negative effects on our patient's
      wellbeing.

TI  - Peri-implant health.
PG  - S249-S256
LID - 10.1002/JPER.16-0424 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim is to define clinical and histologic characteristics of
      peri-implant tissues in health and describe the mucosa-implant interface.
      IMPORTANCE: An understanding of the characteristics of healthy peri-implant
      tissues facilitates the recognition of disease (i.e., departure from health).
      FINDINGS: The healthy peri-implant mucosa is, at the microscopic level, comprised
      of a core of connective tissue covered by either a keratinized (masticatory
      mucosa) or non-keratinized epithelium (lining mucosa). The peri-implant mucosa
      averages about 3 to 4 mm high, and presents with an epithelium (about 2 mm long) 
      facing the implant surface. Small clusters of inflammatory cells are usually
      present in the connective tissue lateral to the barrier epithelium. Most of the
      intrabony part of the implant appears to be in contact with mineralized bone
      (about 60%), while the remaining portion faces bone marrow, vascular structures, 
      or fibrous tissue. During healing following implant installation, bone modeling
      occurs that may result in some reduction of the marginal bone level. CONCLUSIONS:
      The characteristics of the peri-implant tissues in health are properly identified
      in the literature, including tissue dimensions and composition. Deviation from
      the features of health may be used by the clinician (and researcher) to identify 
      disease, including peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Implantation of a prosthesis after post-traumatic knee arthritis
      poses challenges derived from the bone defects and soft tissue damage. The
      objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of 
      the use of metaphyseal sleeves in primary total knee arthroplasty surgery after
      post-traumatic arthritis. METHODS: Clinical and radiological results of 25
      patients undergoing surgery for post-traumatic knee arthritis were prospectively 
      evaluated. A semi-constrained, mobile platform prosthesis with metaphyseal
      sleeves was implanted. American Knee Society scales, Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Short Form 12 Health Survey were
      used. Patients were evaluated at the baseline and at postoperative months three, 
      12, and annually until final follow-up. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 79months 
      with a maximum of 10years. Mean Knee Society Score (KSS) increased from 29 to 78,
      and functional KSS from 42 to 81. The average WOMAC pain index changed from 12 to
      three; average WOMAC stiffness improved from four to one, and WOMAC function
      score improved from 44 to 16. The mean physical SF12 varied from 30 to 46, while 
      mental SF-12 varied from 45 to 55. Radiological osseointegration of the implants 
      was considered optimal in all cases, with a survival of 100%. CONCLUSIONS:
      Metaphyseal sleeves in combination with varus-valgus constrained (VVC) components
      and a rotating platform, have shown good clinical and radiological results in
      patients with post-traumatic knee arthritis and constitute a reliable alternative
      for treatment of this disease when the epiphyseal zone is deteriorated and has
      bone defects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients search YouTube for health-care information. PURPOSE: To
      examine what YouTube offers patients seeking information on dental implants, and 
      to evaluate the quality of provided information. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A
      systematic search of YouTube for videos containing information on dental implants
      was performed using the key words Dental implant and Tooth replacement. Videos
      were examined by two senior Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery residents who were
      trained and calibrated to perform the search. Initial assessment was performed to
      exclude non- English language videos, duplicate videos, conference lectures, and 
      irrelevant videos. Included videos were analyzed with regard to demographics and 
      content's usefulness. Information for patients available from the American
      Academy of Implant Dentistry, European Association of Osseointegration, and
      British Society of Restorative Dentistry were used for benchmarking. RESULTS: A
      total of 117 videos were analyzed. The most commonly discussed topics were
      related to procedures involved in dental implantology (76.1%, n=89), and to the
      indications for dental implants (58.1%, n=78). The mean usefulness score of
      videos was poor (6.02 +/-4.7 [range 0-21]), and misleading content was common
      (30.1% of videos); mainly in topics related to prognosis and maintenance of
      dental implants. Most videos (83.1%, n=97) failed to mention the source of
      information presented in the video or where to find more about dental implants.
      CONCLUSIONS: Information about dental implants on YouTube is limited in quality
      and quantity. YouTube videos can have a potentially important role in modulating 
      patients attitude and treatment decision regarding dental implants.

AB  - Purpose: Zirconia is a potential alternative to titanium for dental and
      orthopedic implants. Here we report the biological and bone integration
      capabilities of a new zirconia surface with distinct morphology at the meso-,
      micro-, and nano-scales. Methods: Machine-smooth and roughened zirconia disks
      were prepared from yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP),
      with rough zirconia created by solid-state laser sculpting. Morphology of the
      surfaces was analyzed by three-dimensional imaging and profiling. Rat
      femur-derived bone marrow cells were cultured on zirconia disks. Zirconia
      implants were placed in rat femurs and the strength of osseointegration was
      evaluated by biomechanical push-in test. Results: The rough zirconia surface was 
      characterized by meso-scale (50 microm wide, 6-8 microm deep) grooves,
      micro-scale (1-10 microm wide, 0.1-3 microm deep) valleys, and nano-scale (10-400
      nm wide, 10-300 nm high) nodules, whereas the machined surface was flat and
      uniform. The average roughness (Ra) of rough zirconia was five times greater than
      that of machined zirconia. The expression of bone-related genes such as collagen 
      I, osteopontin, osteocalcin, and BMP-2 was 7-25 times upregulated in osteoblasts 
      on rough zirconia at the early stage of culture. The number of attached cells and
      rate of proliferation were similar between machined and rough zirconia. The
      strength of osseointegration for rough zirconia was twice that of machined
      zirconia at weeks two and four of healing, with evidence of mineralized tissue
      persisting around rough zirconia implants as visualized by electron microscopy
      and elemental analysis. Conclusion: This unique meso-/micro-/nano-scale rough
      zirconia showed a remarkable increase in osseointegration compared to
      machine-smooth zirconia associated with accelerated differentiation of
      osteoblasts. Cell attachment and proliferation were not compromised on rough
      zirconia unlike on rough titanium. This is the first report introducing a rough
      zirconia surface with distinct hierarchical morphology and providing an effective
      strategy to improve and develop zirconia implants.

TI  - Sclerostin-Neutralizing Antibody Enhances Bone Regeneration Around Oral Implants.
PG  - 1672-1679
LID - 10.1089/ten.TEA.2018.0013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental implants are an important option for replacement of missing
      teeth. A major clinical challenge is how best to accelerate bone regeneration and
      reduce the healing time for functional restoration after implant placement. A
      sclerostin-neutralizing antibody (Scl-Ab) has been shown to enhance alveolar bone
      formation and fracture repair. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      effects of systemic administration of Scl-Ab on dental implant osseointegration
      and bone regeneration in an experimental alveolar ridge tooth extraction model.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate the effects of Scl-Ab on bone regeneration 
      and dental implant osseointegration, an experimental alveolar bone osteotomy rat 
      model was adopted. One month after extraction of maxillary right first molars,
      osteotomy defects were created at the coronal aspect of each of the extraction
      sites, and 1 x 2-mm custom titanium implants were installed into the osteotomies.
      Coincident with implant placement, Scl-Ab was administered subcutaneously at a
      dose of 25 mg/kg twice weekly for 10-28 days and compared with a vehicle control.
      Animals were sacrificed 10, 14, and 28 days after surgery, and maxillae were
      harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography (microCT), histology, and
      histomorphometry. RESULTS: microCT analysis demonstrated that the maxillary bone 
      volume fraction was approximately 2- to 2.5-fold greater in Scl-Ab-treated
      animals compared with vehicle alone at days 14 and 28. Consistent with those
      findings, two-dimensional bone fill percentages within the coronal osteotomy
      sites were highest in Scl-Ab treatment groups at 28 days. In addition,
      bone-implant contact at 28 days was approximately twofold greater in the Scl-Ab
      group compared with the vehicle control. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that
      systemic Scl-Ab administration enhances osseointegration and bone regeneration
      around dental implants. This approach offers potential as a treatment modality
      for patients with low bone mass or bone defects to achieve more predictable bone 
      regeneration at alveolar bone defects and to enhance dental implant
      osseointegration.

TI  - Reusing dental implants?: an experimental study for detecting the success rates
      of re-osseointegration.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/s40729-018-0130-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to histomorphometrically compare the
      implant-host integration between retrieved implants and new implants. METHODS:
      Jaws in 10 male beagle dogs were divided into four groups, and 36 dental implants
      were inserted into the jaws. In groups 1 and 2, experimental peri-implantitis was
      induced within 2 months after implant insertion. In group 1, surface
      decontamination of implants was achieved using air-flow and citric acid. In group
      2, implants were sterilized with autoclave after air-flow and citric acid surface
      decontamination. Subsequently, these implants were inserted in contralateral jaws
      of the same dogs and a 3-month period was allowed for osseointegration. In group 
      3, the implants were removed from human jaws due to peri-implantitis and were
      inserted into dog jaws following surface cleaning protocol and sterilization with
      autoclave and a 3-month period was allowed for osseointegration. Group 4 was set 
      as the control group. After the osseointegration period, all the animals were
      sacrificed. The degree of osseointegration in all groups was evaluated by
      evaluating the ISQ values and by using histomorphometric measurements. RESULTS:
      Histological findings showed that bone-implant contact (BIC) percentage (mean +/-
      SD) was 83.39% +/- 6.37 in group 1, 79.93% +/- 11.83 in group 2, 75.45% +/- 9.09 
      in group 3, and 80.53 +/- 5.22 in group 4. Moreover, the resonance frequency
      analysis (RFA) and ISQ values were similar in all four groups both before and
      after the implantation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this experimental study
      indicated that there is no significant difference between new dental implants and
      re-used dental implants with regards to osseointegration around the implant.

TI  - Osseointegration of zirconia implants with 3 varying surface textures and a
      titanium implant: A histological and micro-CT study.
PG  - 1173-1179

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zirconium - a bioinert metal - in comparison with titanium implants, 
      offers a variety of potential advantages for use in the esthetic area of
      dentistry due to its tooth-like color. Zirconium dental implants are considered
      to be an alternative method of treatment to conventional titanium dental implants
      for patients with a thin gingival biotype. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to
      study the bone tissue response to new zirconia implants with modified surfaces in
      comparison with commercially available titanium dental implants and commercially 
      available zirconia implants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out on a
      group of 12 16-month-old minipigs. New zirconia implants with 3 different
      surfaces were used: M1 - blasted surface, M2 - etched surface and M3 - blasted
      and etched surface (Maxon Motor GmbH, Sexau, Germany) and compared to
      conventional titanium implants with an sandblasted and acid etched (SLA) surface 
      (Straumann GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) and commercially available zirconia implants 
      (Ziterion GmbH, Uffenheim, Germany). Histological and micro-computed tomopgraphy 
      (micro-CT) evaluation was performed. RESULTS: In the micro-CT assessment, the
      average bone-implant contact (BIC) of the zirconia experimental implants was
      41.44%. In particular, the BIC% for M1 was 39.72%, for M2 it was 43.97%, and for 
      M3 - 40.63%; in the control group it was 49.63% and 27.77% for ceramic and
      titanium control implants, respectively. The intra-group analysis showed no
      statistically important differences between the BIC values for implants in any
      group. However, the analysis of BIC for different regions of the same implant
      showed statistically significant differences in all of the groups between the
      results of the threaded region and the neck and the apex. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results of our study suggest that zirconia implants with modified surfaces
      display features of osseointegration similar to those of titanium implants. These
      results are promising in using zirconia implants for dental applications in the
      future.

AB  - Coating materials applied for intraosseous implants must be optimized to
      stimulate osseointegration. Osseointegration is a temporal and spatial
      physiological process that not only requires interactions between osteogenesis
      and angiogenesis but also necessitates a favorable immune microenvironment. It is
      now well-documented that hierarchical nano-micro surface structures promote the
      long-term stability of implants, the interactions between nano-micro structure
      and the immune response are largely unknown. Here, we report the effects of
      microporous titanium (Ti) surfaces coated with nano-hydroxyapatite (HA) produced 
      by micro-arc oxidation and steam-hydrothermal treatment (SHT) on multiple cell
      behavior and osseointegration. By altering the processing time of SHT it was
      possible to shift HA structures from nano-particles to nano-rods on the
      microporous Ti surfaces. Ti surfaces coated with HA nano-particles were found to 
      modulate the inflammatory response resulting in an osteoimmune microenvironment
      more favorable for osteo-/angio-genesis, most likely via the activation of
      certain key signaling pathways (TGF-beta, OPG/RANKL, and VEGF). By contrast, Ti
      surfaces coated with nano-rod shaped HA particles had a negative impact on
      osteo-/angio-genesis and osteoimmunomodulation. In vivo results further
      demonstrated that Ti implant surfaces decorated with HA nano-particles can
      stimulate new bone formation and osseointegration with enhanced interaction
      between osteocytes and implant surfaces. This study demonstrated that Ti implants
      with micro-surfaces coated with nano-particle shaped HA have a positive impact on
      osseointegration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Osteo-/angio-genesis are of
      importance during osteointegration of the implants. Recent advances unravel that 
      immune response of macrophages and its manipulated osteoimmunomodulation also
      exerts a pivotal role to determine the fate of the implant. Surface nano-micro
      modification has evidenced to be efficient to influence osteogenesis, however,
      little is known links nano-microstructured surface to immune response, as well
      the osteoimmunomodulation. This study demonstrates that the nano-particles
      decorated micro-surface, compared with the nano-rods decorated micro-surface
      enables osteogenesis and angiogenesis concurrently that has not been investigated
      previously. This study also unravels that the immune response of macrophages can 
      be manipulated by the nano-micro surface, especially the nano-dimension matters, 
      leading to a differential effect on osteointegration. The additional knowledge
      obtained from this study may provide foundation and reference for future design
      of the coating materials for implantable materials.

AB  - Transcutaneous osseointegrated prostheses provide stable connections to the
      skeleton while eliminating skin lesions experienced with socket prosthetics.
      Additive manufacturing can create custom textured implants capable of interfacing
      with amputees' residual bones. Our objective was to compare osseointegration of
      textured surface implants made by electron beam melting (EBM), an additive
      manufacturing process, to machine threaded implants. Whole body vibration was
      investigated to accelerate osseointegration. Two cohorts of Sprague-Dawley rats
      received bilateral, titanium implants (EBM vs. threaded) in their tibiae. One
      cohort comprising five groups vibrated at 45 Hz: 0.0 (control), 0.15, 0.3, 0.6 or
      1.2g was followed for six weeks. Osseointegration was evaluated through torsional
      testing and bone volume fraction (BV/TV). A second cohort, divided into two
      groups (control and 0.6g), was followed for 24 days and evaluated for resonant
      frequency, bone-implant contact (BIC) and fluorochrome labeling. The EBM textured
      implants exhibited significantly improved mechanical stability independent of
      vibration, highlighting the benefits of using EBM to produce custom textured
      surfaces. Bone formation on and around the EBM textured implants increased
      compared to machined implants, as seen by BIC and fluorescence. No difference in 
      torque, BIC or fluorescence among vibration levels was detected. BV/TV
      significantly increased at 0.6g compared to control for both implant types.

TI  - Bioactive-hybrid-zirconia implant surface for enhancing osseointegration: an in
      vivo study.
PG  - 20
LID - 10.1186/s40729-018-0129-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zirconia is characterized by a hard, dense, and chemically inert
      surface which requires additional surface treatments in order to enhance
      osseointegration. The proposed hypothesis of the study was that combination of a 
      nano-porous surface infiltrated with a bioactive material may enhance
      osseointegration of zirconia implants. METHODS: Custom-made zirconia implants
      (3.7 mm x 8 mm) were designed, milled, and sintered according to manufacturer
      recommendations. All implants received selective infiltration etching (SIE)
      technique to produce a nano-porous surface. Surface porosities were either filled
      with nano-hydroxy apatite particle- or platelet-rich plasma while uncoated
      surface served as a control (n = 12, alpha = 0.05). New surface properties were
      characterized with mercury porosimetry, XRD analysis, SEM, and EDX analysis.
      Implants were inserted in femur head of rabbits, and histomorphometric analysis
      was conducted after healing time to evaluate bone-implant contact percentage
      (BIC%). RESULTS: Selective infiltration etching produced a nano-porous surface
      with interconnected surface porosities. Mercury porosimetry revealed a
      significant reduction in total porosity percent after application of the two
      coating materials. XRD patterns detected hexagonal crystal structure of HA
      superimposed on the tetragonal crystal phase of zirconia. Histomorphometric
      analysis indicated a significantly higher (F = 14.6, P < 0.001) BIC% around
      HA-bioactive-hybrid surface (79.8 +/- 3%) and PRP-coated surface (71 +/- 6 %)
      compared to the control (49 +/- 8%). CONCLUSIONS: Bioactive-hybrid-zirconia
      implant surface enhanced osseointegration of zirconia implants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the successful clinical application of titanium (Ti) as a
      biomaterial, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for Ti
      osseointegration remains unclear, especially because of the limited
      methodological tools available in this field. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we
      present a microscopic and molecular characterization of an oral implant
      osseointegration model using C57Bl/6 mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-eight male
      wild-type mice received a Ti implant on the edentulous alveolar crest and the
      peri-implant sites were evaluated through microscopic (muCT, histological and
      birefringence) and molecular (RealTimePCRarray) analysis in different points in
      time after surgery (3, 7, 14 and 21 days). RESULTS: The early stages of
      osseointegration were marked by an increased expression of growth factors and MSC
      markers. Subsequently, a provisional granulation tissue was formed, with high
      expression of VEGFb and earlier osteogenic markers (BMPs, ALP and Runx2). The
      immune/inflammatory phase was evidenced by an increased density of inflammatory
      cells, and high expression of cytokines (TNF, IL6, IL1) chemokines (CXCL3, CCL2, 
      CCL5 and CXC3CL1) and chemokine receptors (CCR2 and CCR5). Also, iNOS expression 
      remained low, while ARG1 was upregulated, indicating predominance of a M2-type
      response. At later points in time, the bone matrix density and volume were
      increased, in agreement with a high expression of Col1a1 and Col21a2. The
      remodelling process was marked by peaks of MMPs, RANKL and OPG expression at 14
      days, and an increased density of osteoclasts. At 21 days, intimate Ti/bone
      contact was observed, with expression of final osteoblast differentiation markers
      (PHEX, SOST), as well as red spectrum collagen fibers. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      demonstrated a unique molecular view of oral osseointegration kinetics in C57Bl/6
      mice, evidencing potential elements responsible for orchestrating cell migration,
      proliferation, ECM deposition and maturation, angiogenesis, bone formation and
      remodeling at the bone-implant interface in parallel with a novel microscopic
      analysis.

TI  - Human Autopsy Study of Peri-implant Dehiscence Defects with Guided Bone
      Regeneration: A Case Report.
LID - 10.11607/prd.3329 [doi]
AB  - This report presents a histologic assessment of guided bone regeneration for
      dehiscence defects treated with bovine bone mineral or a combination of
      autogenous and synthetic bone. The samples were obtained from an autopsy specimen
      donated by a patient, which is a rare opportunity to evaluate long-term results
      of guided bone regeneration and osseointegration. The values for bone-to-implant 
      contact were similar in both sites. The augmentation with bovine bone mineral
      demonstrated bone reconstruction after 1 year, whereas the augmentation with
      autogenous and synthetic bone failed to maintain the augmented volume, eventually
      leading to mucosal recession after 5.5 years.

TI  - The "Magnesium Sacrifice" Strategy Enables PMMA Bone Cement Partial
      Biodegradability and Osseointegration Potential.
LID - E1746 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms19061746 [doi]
AB  - Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-based bone cements are the most commonly used
      injectable orthopedic materials due to their excellent injectability and
      mechanical properties. However, their poor biocompatibility and excessive
      stiffness may cause complications such as aseptic implant loosening and stress
      shielding. In this study, we aimed to develop a new type of partially
      biodegradable composite bone cement by incorporating magnesium (Mg) microspheres,
      known as "Mg sacrifices" (MgSs), in the PMMA matrix. Being sensitive to the
      physiological environment, the MgSs in PMMA could gradually degrade to produce
      bioactive Mg ions and, meanwhile, result in an interconnected macroporous
      structure within the cement matrix. The mechanical properties, solidification,
      and biocompatibility, both in vitro and in vivo, of PMMA(-)Mg bone cement were
      characterized. Interestingly, the incorporation of Mg microspheres did not
      markedly affect the mechanical strength of bone cement. However, the maximum
      temperature upon setting of bone cement decreased. This partially biodegradable
      composite bone cement showed good biocompatibility in vitro. In the in vivo
      study, considerable bony ingrowth occurred in the pores upon MgS degradation.
      Together, the findings from this study indicate that such partially biodegradable
      PMMA(-)Mg composite may be ideal bone cement for minimally invasive orthopedic
      surgeries such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.

AB  - When bone implants are loaded, they are inevitably subjected to displacement
      relative to bone. Such micromotion generates stress/strain states at the
      interface that can cause beneficial or detrimental sequels. The objective of this
      study is to better understand the mechanobiology of bone healing at the
      tissue-implant interface during repeated loading. Machined screw shaped Ti
      implants were placed in rat tibiae in a hole slightly bigger than the implant
      diameter. Implants were held stable by a specially-designed bone plate that
      permits controlled loading. Three loading regimens were applied, (a) zero
      loading, (b) one daily loading session of 60 cycles with an axial force of
      1.5N/cycle for 7 days, and (c) two such daily sessions with the same axial force 
      also for 7 days. Finite element analysis was used to characterize the
      mechanobiological conditions produced by the loading sessions. After 7 days, the 
      implants with surrounding interfacial tissue were harvested and processed for
      histological, histomorphometric and DNA microarray analyses. Histomorphometric
      analyses revealed that the group subjected to repeated loading sessions exhibited
      a significant decrease in bone-implant contact and increase in bone-implant
      distance, as compared to unloaded implants and those subjected to only one
      loading session. Gene expression profiles differed during osseointegration
      between all groups mainly with respect to inflammatory and unidentified gene
      categories. The results indicate that increasing the daily cyclic loading of
      implants induces deleterious changes in the bone healing response, most likely
      due to the accumulation of tissue damage and associated inflammatory reaction at 
      the bone-implant interface.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of implant design on the change in the
      natural frequency of bone-implant system during osseointegration by means of a
      modal 3D finite element analysis. METHODS: Six implants were considered. Solid
      models were obtained by means of reverse engineering techniques. The mandibular
      bone geometry was built-up from a CT scan dataset through image segmentation.
      Each implant was virtually implanted in the mandibular bone. Two different models
      have been considered, differing in the free length of the mandibular branch
      ('long branch' and 'short branch') in order to simulate the variability of
      boundary conditions when performing vibrometric analyses. Modal analyses were
      carried out for each model, and the first three resonance frequencies were
      assessed with the respective vibration modes. RESULTS: With reference to the
      'long branch' model, the first three modes of vibration are whole bone vibration 
      with minimum displacement of the implant relative to bone, with the exception of 
      the initial condition (1% bone maturation) where the implant is not
      osseointegrated. By contrast, implant displacements become relevant in the 'short
      branch' model, unless osseointegration level is beyond 20%. The difference
      between resonance frequency at whole bone maturation and resonance frequency at
      1% bone maturation remained lower than 6.5% for all modes, with the exception of 
      the third mode of vibration in the 'D' implant where this difference reached
      9.7%. With reference to the 'short branch', considering the first mode of
      vibration, 61-68% of the frequency increase was achieved at 10% osseointegration;
      72-79% was achieved at 20%; 89-93% was achieved at 50% osseointegration. The
      pattern of the natural frequency versus the osseointegration level is similar
      among different modes of vibration. SIGNIFICANCE: Resonance frequencies and their
      trends towards osseointegration level may differ between implant designs, and in 
      different boundary conditions that are related to implant position inside the
      mandible; tapered implants are the most sensitive to bone maturation levels,
      small implants have very little sensitivity. Resonance frequencies are less
      sensitive to bone maturation level beyond 50%.

AB  - Bone regeneration and reosseointegration around a dental implant were
      radiographically and histologically analyzed after regenerative treatment for
      peri-implantitis, using a case from a human autopsy. A block specimen including
      the tissue around the implants was obtained from the patient, who died from
      cancer 20 months after regenerative surgery using a synthetic bone substitute to 
      treat peri-implantitis. Microcomputed tomographic and histologic analyses were
      performed. Three-wall intrabony defects at the implant placed at the site of the 
      mandibular left first molar and a circumferential defect at the implant at the
      site of the mandibular left second molar were substantially filled with newly
      formed bone and residual bone substitute particles, and reosseointegration on the
      previously exposed implant surface was histologically observed.

LID - 10.4103/njcp.njcp_82_17 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of
      biostimulation lasers and ozone therapy on osseointegration of immediately loaded
      implants. Materials and Methods: A total number of 100 implants (DTI Implant
      Systems) were applied to 25 patients evenly. Temporary crowns were applied to
      each patient on the same session as the surgery. Implants were divided into four 
      treatment groups (Group 1: low-level laser therapy (LLLT) group, Group 2: ozone
      therapy group, Group 3: different protocol of ozone therapy group, and Group 4:
      control group) each with 25 implants. The irradiations were performed with a
      gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode low-level laser (Laser BTL-4000) to Group 1.
      Ozone therapy was performed using an ozone generator (OzoneDTA) with an intraoral
      probe to Group 2 and Group 3. Results: In this study, the overall implant
      survival rate was 92% after a 6-month observation period. The implant stability
      quotient values were found significantly higher in Group 1 (LLLT group) and Group
      3 (different protocol of ozone therapy group) than the other groups (P < 0.05).
      There was no significant difference in Group 2 (ozone therapy group) and the
      control group (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Our results suggest that both LLLT and
      ozone therapy with prolonged application time are promising methods to enhance
      bone healing around immediately loaded implants and increase implant stability;
      however, there is a need for more studies on this subject for these methods to
      become routine applications.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical effect of simplified drilling method and
      conventional drilling method in implants. Methods: A total of 46 patients (62
      implants) were enrolled in this study that with dentition defect from May 2015 to
      May 2016 in the Implant department of Xi'an Jiao Tong University. The
      experimental group and the control group were randomly assigned according to the 
      random number method, 23 cases in each group. The experimental group used the
      simplified drilling method (guided drill+ final drill), the control group using
      the conventional drilling method (step by step drill). The operation time,
      implant stability, marginal bone resorption rate and implant retention rate were 
      compared between the two drilling methods. Results: The retention of the
      experiment group was 97% (31/32), the the control group was 100% (30/30). The
      operative time in the experiment group [(4.9+/-0.5) min] was significantly lower 
      from the control group [(8.9+/-2.0) min] (P=0.000). There was no significant
      difference between the two methods in bone resorption (P=0.197), implant
      stability (P>0.05) and implant survival rate (P=0.492). Conclusions: The
      simplified drilling method can significantly reduce the operation time without
      compromising the clinical outcomes, and the osseointegration is well. The
      simplified drilling method should be used when sufficient bone mass, careful use 
      in class II bone, forbidden in class I bone.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Titanium based (Ti-based) materials have been used as dental
      implants due to their high biocompatibility, good mechanical strength and ideal
      osseointegration properties. Osseointegration of an implant is dependent on
      surface characteristics such as surface chemistry and topography. Nanotechnology 
      has presented new and interesting applications in dentistry in recent years. The 
      presence of nanoparticles on the implant surface can affect both the topography
      and surface chemistry, leading to different and outstanding specifications for
      implant. METHOD: A literature review was performed in electronic databases by
      means of MeSH keywords to collect relevant published literature in English about 
      the effect of nanohydroxyapatite on osseointegration of titanium implants. No
      limitations on publication date were imposed. Data regarding titanium implants;
      nanotechnology; nanohydroxyapatite; osseointegration and cell attachment were
      collected and reviewed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: According to reviewed literature,
      nanohydroxyapatites have a nanostructured surface with higher surface area and
      then higher reactivity, letting them to bind to bone creating a biomimetic
      coating on implants. However, more studies are needed on the cell-substrate
      interface to develop an effective implant due to the interaction of the cells and
      the biomaterial surface after the implantation.

TI  - Promotion of Osseointegration Using Protamine/Alginate/Bone Morphogenic Protein 2
      Biofunctionalized Composite Coating on Nanopolymorphic Titanium Surfaces.
PG  - 933-945
LID - 10.1166/jbn.2018.2506 [doi]
AB  - A bioactive paradigm is required to promote osseointegration of implant
      materials. Here, a protamine/alginate/bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2)
      biofunctionalized composite coating was created on nanopolymorphic titanium (Ti) 
      surfaces to promote the osseointegration of Ti implants. Alkali and heat (AH)
      treatment was used to make porous Ti implants (TiAH) with a superhydrophilic and 
      negatively charged surface, which facilitates the adsorption of a positively
      charged protamine/alginate/protamine (TiAH-Pro/Alg/Pro) coating.
      Biofunctionalization of the substrate was achieved via further immobilization of 
      exogenous BMP2 (TiAH-Pro/Alg/Pro-BMP2). The results indicated the successful
      deposition of Pro/Alg/Pro coatings onto porous TiAH substrates. In addition, the 
      initial burst release of the adsorbed protein was effectively dampened by the
      TiAH-Pro/Alg/Pro coating, allowing uniform protein distribution and sustained
      biomolecule release. In comparison with the pristine Ti, the three modified
      substrates showed good cytocompatibility and promoted cell adhesion in the
      initial period. The adherent cells on the TiAH-Pro/Alg/Pro surface and
      TiAH-Pro/Alg/Pro-BMP2 substrate exhibited distinct shapes compared to those on
      the pristine Ti and TiAH surfaces. Moreover, TiAH-Pro/Alg/Pro-BMP2 significantly 
      improved the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and enhanced
      the osseointegration in the in vivo rat model. Such facilitative effects may be
      achieved by activating integrins and the BMP/Smad signaling pathway. This study
      highlights the potential of combining inorganic with organic surface
      modifications for accelerating the osseointegration of implant materials.

TI  - Influence of the Buccal Bone Crest Width on Peri-Implant Hard and Soft Tissues
      Dimensions: A Histomorphometric Study in Humans.
PG  - 415-423
LID - 10.1097/ID.0000000000000772 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To histologically evaluate hard and soft tissues adaptation at
      screw-shaped devices installed at recipient sites in the distal segments of the
      alveolar edentulous ridge prepared with a buccal bone width of 1 or 2 mm.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen volunteers received 2 nonsubmerged titanium
      implants each; after 3 months, biopsies were obtained and processed for
      histology. The distances between implant shoulder (IS), top of the bony crest
      (C), coronal level of osseointegration (B), peri-implant mucosa (PM), and apical 
      extension of the junctional epithelium (aJE) were measured. RESULTS: There were
      no significant statistically differences between test and control sites regarding
      IS-C, IS-B, PM-IS, PM-B, PM-aJE, aJE-B measurements. The horizontal bone
      resorption 1 mm below IS was 0.3 +/- 0.3 and 1.0 +/- 0.7 mm at the test and
      control sites, respectively. This difference was statistically significant.
      CONCLUSIONS: Similar hard and soft tissues dimensions were observed in both
      groups. However, a higher horizontal bone resorption was seen at the control
      sites. Nonsubmerged implant installation should be performed when a 1 mm buccal
      bony crest width is present so as to limit the horizontal bone resorption.

TI  - Thermal oxidation and hydrofluoric acid treatment on the sandblasted implant
      surface: A histologic histomorphometric and biomechanical study.
PG  - 741-755
LID - 10.1111/clr.13285 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to analyze and compare the topographical, chemical, 
      and osseointegration characteristics of a sandblasted acid-etched surface (SLA
      group), a sandblasted thermally oxidized surface (SO group), and a surface
      chemically modified by hydrofluoric (HF) acid (SOF group). MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Following the preparation and characterization of the relevant surfaces, 90
      implants (30 for each group) were placed on the pelvic bone of six sheep.
      Resonance frequency analysis (RFA), insertion (ITV), removal torque value (RTV), 
      and histomorphometric analyses (BIC%) were performed after three and 8 weeks of
      healing. The results were analyzed by nonparametric tests (p < 0.05). RESULTS:
      The roughness value (Ra) in the SOF group was significantly lower than the SLA
      and the SO group (p = 0.136, p < 0.001, respectively). This resulted in a
      substantially inferior ITV 14.83 N/cm (SD: 4.04) than those achieved in the SLA
      and SO groups (19.50 (SD: 6.07) and 20.17 N/cm (SD: 8.95), respectively; p =
      0.001). A statistically significant change in the RFA from the baseline (47.36
      ISQ, SD: 6.93) to the 3rd week (62.56 ISQ, SD: 5.29) was observed in the SOF
      group only (p = 0.008). The highest postplacement RFA and RTV values were
      measured from the SLA group (61.11 ISQ, SD: 7.51 and 78.22 N/cm, SD: 28.73). The 
      early-term (3rd week) BIC% was highest in the SO group (39.93%, SD: 16.14). After
      8 weeks, the differences in BIC% values were statistically not significant.
      CONCLUSIONS: Adjunct HF acid application on the thermally oxidized surface did
      not provide an additional benefit compared to the sandblasted and acid-etched
      surface (SLA group).

TI  - Immediate loading implants: review of the critical aspects.
PG  - 129-139
LID - 10.11138/orl/2017.10.2.129 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Modern dentistry have witnessed, a rapid and continuing evolution.
      Concerning the implant-rehabilitation protocols, they have been redefined in
      order to satisfy patient's increasing expectations in terms of comfort, aesthetic
      and shorter treatment period. The purpose of this review is to explore the
      concept of implant immediate loading and the indications for clinical practice.
      All the critical aspects that could influence the outcomes of this treatment will
      also be considered. Materials and methods: Three protocols for implant load
      timing have been classified: immediate loading implants (ILI); early loading
      implants (ELI); and conventional loading implants (CLI). Two subclassifications
      point out the different loading modality: 1) Occlusal loading or Non-Occlusal
      loading, 2) Direct loading or Progressive loading. Micromovements have been
      considered, since the start of implant dentistry, one of the main risk for the
      success of osseointegration. The determinant and most accessible parameter to
      assess the primary stability is the implant insertion torque value. To achieve
      the necessary torque value to perform immediate loading, it is therefore
      important to evaluate the bone density at the implant site. Computerized
      tomography (CT) has been regarded as the best radiographic method to evaluate the
      residual bone. Results: The clinical success of this technique is highly
      dependent on many factors: patient selection, bone quality and quantity, implant 
      number and design, implant primary stability, occlusal loading and clinician's
      surgical ability. Among these, implant primary stability is undoubtedly the most 
      important. Conclusion: Studies on ILI show that successful outcome can be
      expected, if the previous criteria are fulfilled. It seems that ILI demonstrate a
      greater risk for implant failure when compared to CLI, although the survival
      rates were high for both the procedures. The use of different surgical
      procedures, type of prostheses, loading times and have very different study
      designs. This lack of homogeneity limits the relevance of the conclusions that
      can be drawn.

TI  - Post extractive implant: evaluation of the critical aspects.
PG  - 119-128
LID - 10.11138/orl/2017.10.2.119 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Nowadays, implant supported prosthetic rehabilitation is a reliable
      procedure to replace compromised or untreatable teeth. The purpose of this review
      is to explore the concept of post extractive implant and the indications for
      clinical practice through an analysis of recent studies in the literature. All
      the main factors that could influence the outcome of this treatment will also be 
      considered. Materials and methods: Focusing on the extraction-socket healing
      time, three different implant insertion protocols have been defined: Immediate
      implant placement (IIP), Early implant placement (EIP), Delayed implant placement
      (DIP). The entity of bone remodeling can be associated with different factors:
      three dimensional implant position, presence/absence of platform switching,
      absence of facial bony wall, inter implant/tooth distance. Results: All the
      studies in literature agreed that implant primary stability is the main condition
      for a successful osseointegration of dental implants. Primary implant stability
      is influenced by many factors including local bone quality and quantity, implant 
      macro-design, soft tissue conditions and rehabilitation, surgical technique,
      prosthetic load timing, oral hygiene. Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence
      in literature to determine possible advantages or disadvantages of IIP, EIP or
      DIP. Studies suggest that IIP and EIP may be at higher risks of implant failures 
      and complications than delayed implants; on the other hand the aesthetic outcome 
      might be better when placing implants just after teeth extraction.

TI  - Hydrophilic implant surfaces - a clinical and scientific update (in German)
PG  - 33-39
AB  - The modification of the implant surface influences implant osseointegration. A
      physico-chemical means to modify implant surfaces is the creation of hydrophilic 
      surfaces. The aim is an accelerated osseointegration for earlier implant loading 
      and possibly the increase of bone quantity and quality. This review gives an
      update on the current scientific knowledge on hydrophilic implant surfaces. In
      vitro, hydrophilic titanium surfaces exhibit different positive effects on hard
      and soft tissues with significant differences to hydrophobic surfaces. Several
      cell types and the initial wound healing phase are positively affected. In vivo, 
      an increased osseointegration is detected in the early phase of wound healing. In
      later stages these significant differences are rarely detectable. Based on
      clinical trials, early implant loading of hydrophilic surfaces is considered safe
      and predictable. There is only few data on hydrophilic surfaces in areas of
      reduced bone quality or quality.

TI  - Role of Wnt11 during Osteogenic Differentiation of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells
      on Microstructured Titanium Surfaces.
PG  - 8588
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-26901-8 [doi]
AB  - Successful osseointegration of an endosseous implant involves migration and
      differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the implant surface.
      Micro-structured, hydrophilic titanium surfaces direct MSCs to undergo
      osteoblastic differentiation in vitro, in the absence of media additives commonly
      used in cultures grown on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). This process
      involves non-canonical Wnt5a, in contrast to canonical Wnt3a typically credited
      with osteoblastic differentiation on TCPS. Wnt proteins have been implicated in
      morphological development and tissue patterning, suggesting that additional Wnts 
      may participate. Here, we demonstrate that Wnt11 is a mediator of osteoblast
      commitment of MSCs, and increases in a surface-roughness dependent manner.
      Experiments using cells silenced for Wnt11 indicate that cross-talk between Wnt5a
      and Wnt11 occurs. Wnt11 potentially acts upstream to Wnt5a, increasing Wnt5a
      expression and factors associated with osteogenesis. Thus, Wnt11 contributes to
      peri-implant bone formation distal to the implant surface through a heavily
      regulated signaling cascade of autocrine/paracrine proteins.

TI  - Use of Patient's Own Natural Teeth as Part of the Interim Prosthesis on
      Immediately Placed Single Implants in a Staged Surgical Approach: A Clinical
      Report.
PG  - 351-357
LID - 10.1563/aaid-joi-D-17-00292 [doi]
AB  - A technique is described where the tooth's natural crown is used as part of the
      interim implant supported prosthesis in clinical situations where a tooth with
      poor prognosis is extracted and an implant is placed immediately after tooth
      extraction. A preliminary impression is made before tooth extraction, and the
      exact tooth positioning is assessed in the laboratory as part of the treatment
      plan. An acrylic resin repositioning jig is fabricated that will guide the
      clinician in seating and orienting the crown intraorally after implant placement 
      is completed. After the natural tooth is extracted and an implant is immediately 
      placed via guided approach, the extracted natural crown is hollowed and placed on
      top of an interim abutment. The natural crown is positioned intraorally by using 
      the acrylic resin repositioning jig. The crown is then internally relined and
      placed as part of the interim implant supported prosthesis. After
      osseointegration has been confirmed, a definitive prosthesis is placed.

TI  - A Review of the Impact of Implant Biomaterials on Osteocytes.
PG  - 977-986
LID - 10.1177/0022034518778033 [doi]
AB  - In lamellar bone, a network of highly oriented interconnected osteocytes is
      organized in concentric layers. Through their cellular processes contained within
      canaliculi, osteocytes are highly mechanosensitive and locally modulate bone
      remodeling. We review the recent developments demonstrating the significance of
      the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network in bone maintenance around implant
      biomaterials. Drilling during implant site preparation triggers osteocyte
      apoptosis, the magnitude of which correlates with drilling speed and heat
      generation, resulting in extensive remodeling and delayed healing. In
      peri-implant bone, osteocytes physically communicate with implant surfaces via
      canaliculi and are responsive to mechanical loading, leading to changes in
      osteocyte numbers and morphology. Certain implant design features allow
      peri-implant osteocytes to retain a less aged phenotype, despite highly advanced 
      extracellular matrix maturation. Physicochemical properties of anodically
      oxidized surfaces stimulate bone formation and remodeling by regulating the
      expression of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand), RANK,
      and OPG (osteoprotegerin) from implant-adherent cells. Modulation of certain
      osteocyte-related molecular signaling mechanisms (e.g., sclerostin blockade) may 
      enhance the biomechanical anchorage of implants. Evaluation of the peri-implant
      osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network should therefore be a necessary component in
      future investigations of osseointegration to more completely characterize the
      biological response to materials for load-bearing applications in dentistry and
      orthopedics.

TI  - Effect of Collagen-Polycaprolactone Nanofibers Matrix Coating on the In Vitro
      Cytocompatibility and In Vivo Bone Responses of Titanium.
PG  - 197-210
LID - 10.1007/s40846-017-0312-7 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to improve the biomechanical performance of
      titanium (Ti) using a biocompatible electrospun nanofiber matrix. The study is
      based on the hypothesis that coating a Ti surface with a nanofiber matrix (NFM)
      made of collagen (CG) and polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun nanofibers could
      increase the mechanical fixation of Ti/bone by improving the surface and
      cytocompatibility properties of Ti. This study prepared Ti samples with and
      without CG-PCL NFM coatings. This study determined the in vitro effects of each
      group of Ti samples on the surface topography and cytocompatibility (osteoblast
      cell adhesion, proliferation, mineralization and protein adsorption) properties. 
      This study also determined in vivo interface shear strength and bone volume
      fraction of each group of Ti samples with bone using a rabbit model. This study
      found that the CG-PCL NFM coating on Ti improved the surface roughness,
      osteoblast cell adhesion, proliferation, mineralization and protein adsorption
      properties of Ti. In vivo studies found that interface shear strength of CG-PCL
      NFM-coated Ti/bone samples was significantly higher compared to those values of
      control Ti/bone samples (p value < 0.05) due to an increase in the amount of
      growth of the connective tissue joining the Ti implant. Therefore, the developed 
      CG-PCL NFM coating technique should further be investigated for its potential in 
      clinical applications.

TI  - A nonlinear homogenized finite element analysis of the primary stability of the
      bone-implant interface.
PG  - 1471-1480
LID - 10.1007/s10237-018-1038-3 [doi]
AB  - Stability of an implant is defined by its ability to undergo physiological
      loading-unloading cycles without showing excessive tissue damage and micromotions
      at the interface. Distinction is usually made between the immediate primary
      stability and the long-term, secondary stability resulting from the biological
      healing process. The aim of this research is to numerically investigate the
      effect of initial implantation press-fit, bone yielding, densification and
      friction at the interface on the primary stability of a simple bone-implant
      system subjected to loading-unloading cycles. In order to achieve this goal,
      human trabecular bone was modeled as a continuous, elasto-plastic tissue with
      damage and densification, which material constants depend on bone volume fraction
      and fabric. Implantation press-fit related damage in the bone was simulated by
      expanding the drilled hole to the outer contour of the implant. The bone-implant 
      interface was then modeled with unilateral contact with friction. The implant was
      modeled as a rigid body and was subjected to increasing off-axis loading cycles. 
      This modeling approach is able to capture the experimentally observed primary
      stability in terms of initial stiffness, ultimate force and progression of
      damage. In addition, it is able to quantify the micromotions around the implant
      relevant for bone healing and osseointegration. In conclusion, the
      computationally efficient modeling approach used in this study provides a
      realistic structural response of the bone-implant interface and represents a
      powerful tool to explore implant design, implantation press-fit and the resulting
      risk of implant failure under physiological loading.

AB  - This study determined the effect of curcumin on bone healing in animals with
      diabetes mellitus (DM). One hundred rats were divided into five groups: DM+PLAC, 
      DM+CURC, DM+INS, DM+CURC+INS, and non-DM (CURC, curcumin; PLAC, placebo; INS,
      insulin). Critical calvarial defects were created and titanium implants were
      inserted into the tibiae. Calvarial defects were analyzed histometrically, and
      BMP-2, OPN, OPG, RANKL, Runx2, Osx, beta-catenin, Lrp-5, and Dkk1 mRNA levels
      were quantified by PCR. The implants were removed for a torque evaluation, the
      peri-implant tissue was collected for mRNA quantification of the same
      bone-related markers, and the tibiae were submitted to micro-computed tomography.
      The DM+CURC+INS and non-DM groups exhibited greater closure of the calvaria when 
      compared to the DM+PLAC group (P<0.05). Increased retention of implants was
      observed in the DM+CURC, DM+CURC+INS, and non-DM groups when compared to the
      DM+PLAC group (P<0.05). CURC improved bone volume and increased bone-implant
      contact when compared to DM+PLAC (P<0.05). In calvarial samples, CURC favourably 
      modulated RANKL/OPG and Dkk1 and improved beta-catenin levels when compared to
      DM+PLAC (P<0.05). In peri-implant samples, Dkk1 and RANKL/OPG were down-regulated
      and BMP-2 up-regulated by CURC when compared to DM+PLAC (P<0.05). CURC reverses
      the harmful effects of DM in bone healing, contributing to the modulation of
      bone-related markers.

TI  - Effect of calcium pyrophosphate on microstructural evolution and in vitro
      biocompatibility of Ti-35Nb-7Zr composite by spark plasma sintering.

AB  - beta-type Ti-35Nb-7Zr alloy has attracted considerable attentions as a bone
      implant material. The alloy, however, has poor bioactivity, which difficult to
      form a strong osseointegration between the bone tissues. Combining Ti alloy with 
      a bioactive and biodegradable ceramic has been of interest to researchers. But
      the large difference in physicochemical property of high-melting metal and
      ceramic elements would bring the manufacturing restriction. In this work,
      Ti-35Nb-7Zr-CPP composites were fabricated with mechanical alloy of Ti, Nb, Zr
      and Nano calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) powders mixture followed by spark plasma
      sintering (SPS) routes. The effect of CPP ceramic on microstructural evolution
      and in vitro biocompatibility were investigated. As the addition of CPP
      (10-30wt%), ceramic elements spreading towards the matrix, the generated
      metal-ceramic bioactive phases CaTiO3 are observed well consolidated with beta-Ti
      matrix. With the CPP increasing, Ca and P atoms rapidly migrated to the beta-Ti
      matrix to form granulated Ti5P3, which leads to the increasing porosity (10%-18%)
      in the composites. The results demonstrated that the favorable cell viability
      (the cell proliferation rates were higher than 100%) and growth inside the pores 
      of the composites arise from the rough micro-porous surface and the release of
      bioactive metal-ceramic phase ions into the biological environment. The enhanced 
      bioactivity and microstructural evolution behaviors of the Ti-35Nb-7Zr-CPP
      composites may provide a strategy for designing and fabricating multifunctional
      implants.

AB  - An alternative to accelerate the osseointegration on titanium dioxide nanotubes
      (TNTs) used in osseointegrated implants is through the functionalization of these
      nanostructured surfaces with biomolecules. In this work, we immobilized a lectin 
      with recognized mitogenic activity, the Cramoll lectin, extracted from Cratylia
      mollis seeds, on surfaces modified by TNTs. For the immobilization of Cramoll on 
      TNTs surfaces, we used the Layer-by-Layer technique (LbL) by growing five
      alternate layers of poly(allylamine) hydrochloride (PAH) and poly(acrylic) acid
      (PAA); lastly we incubated the lectin, at different concentrations, with the
      TNTs-LbL. Before and after the immobilization procedures, the substrate surfaces 
      were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform
      infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and, electrochemical
      impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We also evaluated the Cramoll activity after
      immobilization on TNTs by using the lectin interaction with ovalbumin. The lectin
      did not lose its biological activity, even after immobilization onto nanotubular 
      arrays. In addition, we observed an increase osteoblast-like cell adhesion on the
      TNTs-LbL-Cramoll system when compared to the bare TNTs surfaces. Moreover, a
      significative cell proliferation was identified on the substrates when Cramoll
      was immobilized at concentrations of 80, 160 and 320mug/mL after 48h of
      incubation by using the resazurin assay. Our results suggest that Cramoll was
      efficiently immobilized on a nanotubular array and this new platform presents a
      great potential to be tested in implantology.

TI  - Biological and Physicochemical Characteristics of 2 Different Hydrophilic
      Surfaces Created by Saline-Storage and Ultraviolet Treatment.
PG  - 405-414
LID - 10.1097/ID.0000000000000773 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of titanium surfaces may affect
      osseointegration. Ordinary titanium surfaces are hydrophobic. Recently, 2
      different methods of storing titanium in saline solution or treating it with
      ultraviolet (UV) light were introduced to generate surface hydrophilicity. This
      study compared biological and physicochemical properties of 2 different
      hydrophilic titanium surfaces created by these methods. MATERIALS: Acid-etched
      control, saline-stored, and UV-treated titanium surfaces were assessed by
      scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and x-ray
      photoelectron spectroscopy. The attachment, spreading behaviors, mineralization, 
      and gene expression of osteoblasts were examined. RESULTS: Similar microroughness
      was found on control and UV-treated surfaces, whereas foreign deposits were
      observed on saline-stored surfaces. Control and UV-treated surfaces consisted of 
      Ti, O, and C, whereas saline-stored surfaces showed Na and Cl in addition to
      these 3 elements. Atomic percentage of surface carbon was higher in order of
      control, saline-stored, and UV-treated surfaces. Osteoblasts cultured on
      saline-stored surfaces showed higher levels of calcium deposition and collagen I 
      expression than control. Osteoblasts on UV-treated surfaces showed significantly 
      increased levels for all parameters related to cell attachment, cell spreading,
      the expression of adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins, mineralization, and gene
      expression compared with control, outperforming saline-stored surfaces for most
      parameters. CONCLUSION: Despite similar hydrophilicity, saline-stored and UV
      light-treated surfaces showed substantially different biological effects on
      osseointegration, associated with different surface chemistry and morphology.

TI  - The effects of Sr-incorporated micro/nano rough titanium surface on rBMSC
      migration and osteogenic differentiation for rapid osteointegration.
PG  - 1946-1961
LID - 10.1039/c8bm00473k [doi]
AB  - Recruitment of endogenous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) has 
      been widely discussed as an alternative strategy for bone regeneration. Strontium
      (Sr) is known to direct the BMSCs' commitment to the bone lineage and encourage
      bone formation; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study,
      an Sr-incorporated micro/nano rough titanium surface (MNT-Sr) was fabricated by
      hydrothermal treatment in an attempt to facilitate BMSCs' recruitment and their
      osteogenic differentiation to enhance rapid osseointegration. Micro rough
      titanium (MT) was set as the control biomaterial. In vitro, MNT-Sr and its
      extracts promoted the migration and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In
      animal studies, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled BMSCs were intravenously 
      injected into wild-type rats for tracing before tibial implantation surgery. The 
      GFP+BMSC recruitment to the implantation site was successfully triggered by
      MNT-Sr implantation. A trend for increased bone area (BA%), bone-implant contact 
      (BIC%) and removal torque values (RTVs) was observed for the MNT-Sr implant
      compared to that observed for MT at 2 weeks. Advanced mechanism analysis
      indicated that Sr2+ enhanced the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 signaling pathway both in vitro
      and in vivo. Taken together, these findings suggest that MNT-Sr has promising
      therapeutic potential for future use in dental implants by homing endogenous stem
      cells to stimulate bone regeneration.

TI  - Peri-Implant Bone Behavior after Single Drill versus Multiple Sequence for
      Osteotomy Drill.
PG  - 9756043
LID - 10.1155/2018/9756043 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: The present study aims to compare the drilling protocol effect on
      osseointegration event in three commercially available titanium dental implants
      with different drill protocol using a rabbit tibia model. Materials and Methods: 
      Three different drilling sequences were compared as follows: drilling sequence
      using a single unique drill of 4.2 mm conical implant (Group 1), drilling
      sequence using 3 consecutive cylindrical drills for a 4.1 mm cylindrical implant 
      (Group 2), and drilling sequence using 3 consecutive conical drills for a 4.3 mm 
      conical implant (Group 3). For each group, 18 drilling procedures and implant
      placements were performed, totalizing 54 commercially available titanium dental
      implants. The samples were removed 6 weeks after implantation. Resonance
      frequency analyses (RFA) were performed immediately after the implantation, and
      at 6 weeks removal torque test (RTt) and histological analysis were performed.
      Results: The RFA measured showed statistical difference between the groups in
      time 1 and no significant statistical differences in time 2 (p > 0.05). In the
      RTt no significant difference was found between the 3 groups tested.
      Histomorphometric analysis showed no significant difference between groups in the
      bone-to-implant contact% (p > 0.05). Conclusion: In the present preclinical
      study, osteotomy using a single bur did not show differences regarding the
      proposed and evaluated tests parameters for assessing the peri-implant behavior.

TI  - Osseointegration in osteoporotic-like condition: A systematic review of
      preclinical studies.
PG  - 933-940
LID - 10.1111/jre.12566 [doi]
AB  - Osteoporosis is one of the most common skeletal disorders affecting a significant
      percentage of people worldwide. Research data suggested that systemic diseases
      such as osteoporosis could act as risk factors for osseointegration, jeopardizing
      the healing process and thus the predictability of dental implant success on
      compromised patients. It is well accepted that preclinical studies in animal
      models reproducing the osteoporotic condition are one of the most important
      stages in the research of new biomaterials and therapeutic modalities. The aim of
      this systematic review was to investigate whether osteoporosis compromises dental
      implant osseointegration in experimental osteoporotic-like conditions. A 3-stage 
      systematic literature research was conducted in MEDLINE via OVID and EMBASE up to
      and including March 2017. Experimental studies reporting on dental implant
      osseointegration on different osteoporotic animal models were assessed. The
      studies had to report on the percentage of bone-to-implant contact (%BIC) as the 
      primary outcome. ARRIVE guidelines for reporting on animal research were applied 
      to evaluate the methodological quality and risk of bias of the studies.
      Fifty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were assessed qualitatively.
      The most adopted animal model was the rat. A variability of %BIC values was
      observed, ranging from 30% to 99% and from 26% to 94% for the healthy and
      osteoporotic group, respectively. The great majority (47) of the included studies
      concluded that estrogen deficiency significantly affects BIC values, 9 studies
      stated that it was not possible to observe statistical differences in BIC between
      ovariectomized and healthy groups and 1 study did not provide a comparison
      between the healthy and osteoporotic group. Owing to the great heterogeneity in
      implant surface, study design, observation time-points, site of implant placement
      and reported outcomes, a meta-analysis could not be performed. An overall high
      risk of bias was observed, owing to the limited information on animal housing and
      husbandry, baseline characteristics and health status, ethical statement and
      allocation to the experimental groups provided. Although the available studies
      seem to suggest a lower osseointegration in osteoporotic-like conditions, no
      robust conclusions can be drawn due to the great heterogeneity and overall low
      quality of the available studies. Future studies with emphasis on minimizing the 
      possible sources of bias and evaluating osseointegration of dental implants
      placed into jawbones instead of long bones are warranted.

TI  - Metaphyseal sleeves in total knee arthroplasty revision: complications, clinical 
      and radiological results. A systematic review of the literature.
PG  - 993-1001
LID - 10.1007/s00402-018-2967-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Total knee arthroplasty revision (TKAr) is increasing of relevance 
      in orthopaedic surgeon daily practice and will become more and more relevant in
      the future. The aim of this study is to summarize indications, complications,
      clinical and radiological mid-term results of metaphyseal sleeves in management
      of bone defects in TKAr. METHODS: A systematic review of English literature was
      performed on Medline. Retrospective or prospective studies with 2 years of
      follow-up (FU) were included. The PRISMA 2009 flowchart and checklist were
      considered to edit the review. Rates of intraoperative fractures, aseptic
      loosening, periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), reoperations and re-revisions
      were extrapolated by the papers. RESULTS: 13 articles with a level of evidence of
      IV were included in the systematic review. 1079 TKAr (1554 sleeves) with a mean
      FU of 4.0 +/- 1.1 years were analysed. The studies showed good clinical and
      functional outcomes. Sleeves allowed a stable metaphyseal fixation and
      osseointegration with an implant and sleeves aseptic survival rate of 97.7 and
      99.2%, respectively. The incidence of PJI was 2.7 +/- 2.4%. The estimated rate of
      reoperations and re-revisions were 14.2 +/- 9.2 and 7.1 +/- 4.8%, respectively.
      CONCLUSION: Metaphyseal sleeves represent a viable option in management of types 
      IIb and III AORI bone defects in TKAr. Further high-quality log-term studies
      would better clarify complications, clinical and radiological results of this
      promising technique in total knee arthroplasty revision.

AB  - Regeneration of alveolar bone for dental implant remains a major issue,
      partifcularly for patients suffering from severe bone adsorption and irregular
      socket trauma. Recapitulating embryological development is becoming an attractive
      approach for engineer organ or three-dimensional tissues from stem cells. In this
      study, we aimed to develop an injectable "cartilaginous" graft with adequate
      mechanical resistance and ideal bone remodelling potential. The cartilaginous
      graft was composed of a particulate decellularised cartilage matrix (PDCM),
      chondrogenically primed bone mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) bricks (CB), and
      enriched platelet-rich plasma (P) gel. In immunodeficient mice, we found that
      angiogenesis occurred quickly inside PDCM-CB-P constructs after implantation,
      thereby improving tissue survival and bone formation. In rabbit tibia bone
      defects around implants, we confirmed that CBs not only transformed into bone
      tissue rapidly, but also significantly promoted bone remodelling and replacement 
      of PDCM, thus realising osseointegration of dental implants within 3 months. In
      conclusion, CBs exhibited the potential for endochondral ossification in vivo,
      and application of a cartilaginous template composed of PDCM, CB, and P provided 
      a minimally-invasive, "free material residual" approach to regenerate alveolar
      bone tissues in vivo. This method could have applications in peri-implant bone
      regeneration.

TI  - Piezoelectric surgery versus conventional drilling for implant site preparation: 
      a meta-analysis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To answer the PICO question: "Among patients to whom an implant is
      placed, does the piezoelectric surgery (PS) compared to the conventional drilling
      (CS) achieve higher implant stability, increase surgical time or improve implant 
      survival rate?" STUDY SELECTION: Two independent authors screened the literature 
      through MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Scopus. Randomized or non-randomized
      controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies comparing implant
      stability and/or clinical outcomes with PS versus CS used for implant site
      preparation published in the last 10 years were included in the search. RESULTS: 
      Five of the 177 articles initially found were included in the meta-analysis. No
      statistically significant differences were found between PS and CS for implant
      stability quotient (ISQ) at baseline (SMD: 0.31; 95 %CI: -0.59 to 1.20; p=0.5).
      However, ISQ values were significantly higher at 2 months (SMD: 0.52; 95 %CI:
      0.03-1.00; p=0.04) and at 3 months (SMD: 0.74; 95 %CI: 0.17-1.32; p=0.01) for CS.
      PS needed significantly more time than CS (SMD: 1.74; 95 %CI: 0.42-3.06; p=0.01) 
      in order to be performed. No differences for implant survival rates were found
      when comparing both techniques (RR: 0.52; 95 %CI: 0.09-2.88; p=0.45).
      CONCLUSIONS: PS has not demonstrated superiority to conventional drilling for
      implant stability during the healing period. PS needs significantly longer
      surgery time than CS. Differences for implant survival rate were not found
      between the two techniques.

TI  - Hydroxyapatite coating on titanium endosseous implants for improved
      osseointegration: Physical and chemical considerations.
PG  - 1055-1059
LID - 10.17219/acem/69084 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For many years, hydroxyapatite (HA) has been used as a bioactive
      endosseous dental implant coating to improve osseointegration. As such, the
      coating needs to be of high purity, adequate thickness, crystalline, and of a
      certain roughness in order to stimulate rapid fixation and form a strong bond
      between the host bone and the implant. There are a number of ways of preparing
      the HA coating, resulting in various coating properties. Herein, we report the
      preparation of the HA coating using a direct electrochemical method without the
      need for subsequent heat treatment. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to
      investigate the physicochemical properties of the HP coating, deposited on
      titanium implants by a modified electrochemical method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The
      coating was characterized in terms of surface chemical composition, structure,
      morphology, coating thickness and roughness. RESULTS: The coating was found to be
      composed of homogenous HA with Ca/P and Ca/O ratios of 1.62 and 0.35,
      respectively. No other forms of calcium phosphate were detected. The degree of
      crystallinity of HA was 92.4%. The surface roughness was moderate (Sa = 1.04 mum)
      with the coating thickness of 2-3 mum. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
      analysis revealed a uniform, integrated layer of rod-like HA crystals with the
      longitudinal axes parallel to the implant surface. CONCLUSIONS: The coating
      reported herein was found to have potentially favorable chemical and physical
      characteristics fostering osseointegration.

TI  - The enhancement of osseointegration using a graphene
      oxide/chitosan/hydroxyapatite composite coating on titanium fabricated by
      electrophoretic deposition.
PG  - 635-645
LID - 10.1002/jbm.b.34156 [doi]
AB  - Titanium (Ti) has been commonly used as an implant material in dentistry and bone
      surgery for several decades. Meanwhile, surface modification of titanium can
      enhance the osseointegration of implants. In this study, a graphene
      oxide/chitosan/hydroxyapatite (GO/CS/HA) composite coating was fabricated by
      electrophoretic deposition on Ti substrates. Subsequently, the surface
      morphology, phase composition, wettability, and bonding strength of this
      composite coating were researched. Additionally, in vitro cytological examination
      was performed, including evaluations of cell adhesion, cell viability, cell
      differentiation, cell mineralization, and osteogenetic factor expression.
      Finally, the in vivo osteogenetic properties were evaluated through an animal
      study, including a histological analysis, a microcomputed tomography, and
      biomechanical tests. The results showed that a homogeneous and crack-free
      GO/CS/HA composite coating was coated on Ti, and the wettability and bonding
      strength of the GO/CS/HA composite coating were enhanced compared with HA, GO/HA,
      and CS/HA coatings. Furthermore, the GO/CS/HA coating greatly heightened the
      cell-material interactions in vitro. Additionally, this GO/CS/HA-Ti implant could
      enhance osseointegration in vivo. Consequently, GO/CS/HA-Ti may have potential
      applications in the field of dental implants. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

TI  - [Domestic artificial cervical disc interface pressure distribution and effect of 
      bone-implant interface pressure on osseointegration].
PG  - 443-450
LID - 10.7507/1002-1892.201610121 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To analyze the distribution of stress in the upper and lower plates of
      the prosthesis-bone interface, and the effect of interface pressure on
      osseointegration. Methods: CT scanning was performed on goats at 1 week after
      artificial cervical disc replacement to establish the finite element model of C
      3, 4. The stress distribution of the upper and lower plates of the interface was 
      observed. At 6 and 12 months after replacement, Micro-CT scan and three
      dimensional reconstruction were performed to measure the bone volume fraction
      (BVF), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th), trabecular
      separation (Tb. Sp), bone mineral density (BMD), bone surface/bone volume
      (BS/BV), and trabecular pattern factor (Tb. Pf). The C 3 lower plate and C 4
      upper plate of 4 normal goat were chosen to made the cylinder of the diameter of 
      2 mm. The gene expressions of receptor activator for nuclear factor kappaB ligand
      (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and
      macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) were detected by real time
      fluorescent quantitative PCR at immediate after cutting and at 24 and 48 hours
      after culture. The samples of appropriate culture time were selected to made
      mechanical loading, and the gene expressions of RANKL, OPG, M-CSF, and TGF-beta
      were detected by real time fluorescent quantitative PCR; no mechanical loading
      samples were used as normal controls. Results: Under 25 N axial loading, the
      stress of the upper plate of C 3, 4 was concentrated to post median region, and
      the stress of the lower plate to middle-front region and two orbits. According to
      stress, the plate was divided into 5 regions. The Micro-CT scan showed that BMD, 
      Tb.Th, BVF, and Tb.N significantly increased, and BS/BV, Tb.Sp, and Tb.Pf
      significantly decreased at 12 months after replacement when compared with ones at
      6 months ( P<0.05). At 24 and 48 hours after culture, the gene expressions of
      RANKL, OPG, and TGF-beta were signifi-cantly higher than those at immediate (
      P<0.05), but no significant difference was found between at 24 and 48 hours after
      culture ( P>0.05). The mechanical loading test results at 24 hours after culture 
      showed that the RANKL and OPG gene expressions and OPG/RANKL ratio in C 3 lower
      plate and C 4 upper plate were significantly up-regulated when compared with
      controls ( P<0.05), but no significant difference was shown in TGF-beta and M-CSF
      gene expressions ( P>0.05). Conclusion: Domestic artificial cervical disc
      endplate has different pressure distribution, the stress of lower plate is higher
      than that of upper plate. Pressure has important effect on local
      osseointegration; the higher pressure area is, the osseointegration is better.
      Under the maximum pressure in interface, the osteoblast proliferation will
      increase, which is advantageous to the local osseointegration.

TI  - Postoperative infections after dental implant placement: Variables associated
      with increased risk of failure.
PG  - 1165-1173
LID - 10.1002/JPER.18-0024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wound infections after dental implant placement are a rare finding
      that might lead to early implant failure. However, the available information on
      this topic is scarce. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted to
      determine factors that may increase the failure rate of dental implants that
      presented a postoperative infection during the osseointegration period.
      Postoperative infections were defined as the presence of pus or fistula in the
      surgical area, with pain or tenderness, swelling, redness, and heat or fever,
      before prosthetic loading. A bivariate and multivariate analysis of the data
      using Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to detect prognostic
      factors for implant failure in patients that suffer infections. RESULTS: The
      patient-based prevalence of postoperative infections after implant placement was 
      2.80% (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 2.04% to 3.83%). Thirty-three out of 37
      (89.19%) patients with infections had to be surgically retreated because of
      antibiotic failure and 65% of the infected implants were removed. The bivariate
      analysis showed a significant association between implant failure and the collar 
      surface (HR: 3.12; 95% CI: 1.16 to 8.41; P = 0.014). Cox proportional-hazards
      regression indicated that rough-surfaced collars increased 2.35 times the
      likelihood of failure (95% CI: 0.87 to 6.37; P = 0.071). CONCLUSIONS: The
      survival of implants placed in the maxilla, with smooth collar, and late-onset of
      infection was higher than those placed in the mandible, with a rough collar and
      early onset of infection. In general, signs of infection after dental implant
      placement compromises the survival rate of the affected fixtures.

TI  - In vitro cell response on CP-Ti surfaces functionalized with TGF-beta1 inhibitory
      peptides.
PG  - 73

AB  - Osseointegration of implants is conversely related to the generation of a fibrous
      tissue capsule around the implant by the host environment. Although TGF-beta1
      plays many roles in regeneration processes, it is the cytokine to be mostly
      associated to the production of fibrotic tissue and thus, its inhibition has
      demonstrated to be beneficial to prevent several fibrotic reactions. Surface
      biofunctionalization enables the immobilization of biologically active molecules 
      on an implant surface to tailor the biological response of the host. Here, we
      studied in vitro biological effects of biofunctionalized CP-Ti surfaces with a
      TGF-beta1 inhibitor peptide, P144. A reliable biofunctionalization process that
      tethers P144 peptides to commercially pure titanium was developed.
      Differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts and fibroblasts on
      P144-functionalized and control surfaces was assessed at the gene expression and 
      protein production levels. Results showed that P144-functionalized surfaces
      reduced expression and production of fibrotic differentiation markers and
      increased osteoblastic differentiation markers. Therefore, biofunctionalization
      of surfaces with TGF-beta1 inhibitor peptides are an alternative promising
      strategy for inducing osseointegration around medical devices and implants.

AB  - Dental arches areas with teeth presenting dentoalveolar ankylosis and replacement
      root resorption can be considered as presenting normal bone, in full
      physiological remodeling process; and osseointegrated implants can be
      successfully placed. Bone remodeling will promote osseointegration, regardless of
      presenting ankylosis and/or replacement root resorption. After 1 to 10 years, all
      dental tissues will have been replaced by bone. The site, angulation and ideal
      positioning in the space to place the implant should be dictated exclusively by
      the clinical convenience, associated with previous planning. One of the
      advantages of decoronation followed by dental implants placement in ankylosed
      teeth with replacement resorption is the maintenance of bone volume in the
      region, both vertical and horizontal. If possible, the buccal part of the root,
      even if thin, should be preserved in the preparation of the cavity for the
      implant, as this will maintain gingival tissues looking fully normal for long
      periods. In the selection of cases for decoronation, the absence of microbial
      contamination in the region - represented by chronic periapical lesions, presence
      of fistula, old unconsolidated root fractures and active advanced periodontal
      disease - is important. Such situations are contraindications to decoronation.
      However, the occurrence of dentoalveolar ankylosis and replacement resorption
      without contamination should neither change the planning for implant
      installation, nor the criteria for choosing the type and brand of dental implant 
      to be used. Failure to decoronate and use dental implants has never been
      reported.

TI  - Effect of Human Wnt10b Transgene Overexpression on Peri-Implant Osteogenesis in
      Ovariectomized Rats.
LID - 10.1089/hum.2018.003 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of human Wnt10b (hWnt10b) transgene 
      expression in ovariectomized (OVX) rats to accelerate osseointegration around
      titanium implants, and to provide a new strategy for treating osteoporosis with
      implants. An in vivo osteoporosis model was generated via bilateral ovariectomy
      in rats, and changes in expression of Wnt pathway-related genes were
      investigated. In OVX rats with a femur defect, hWnt10b expressed from an
      adenovirus vector was locally delivered to the defect site prior to implant
      placement. Surrounding femur tissues were collected 1 and 3 weeks after
      implantation for imaging, biomechanical testing, and molecular and histological
      analyses. In an in vitro model, bone-marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) transfected
      with adenovirus containing hWnt10b (Ad-hWnt10b) were cultured for 2 weeks in
      adipogenic medium followed by 2 weeks in osteogenic induction medium. Alizarin
      Red staining and Oil Red O staining, as well as reverse transcription polymerase 
      chain reaction and Western blot analyses, were performed to assess the effect of 
      hWnt10b expression on BMSC differentiation. Expression of Wnt pathway genes was
      significantly downregulated in OVX rats. OVX rats treated with Ad-hWnt10b prior
      to induction of a femur defect showed markedly increased ALP, Runx-2, and
      osteocalcin expression and decreased cathepsin K expression. Histological and
      imaging analysis showed increases in the number of osteocalcin-positive cells and
      the density of newly formed bone surrounding the implant in the Ad-hWnt10b group 
      relative to the untreated control. Meanwhile, Ad-hWnt10b-BMSCs showed
      significantly increased osteogenesis and decreased adipogenesis. hWnt10b may
      accelerate osseointegration around implants and subsequently enhance bone
      regeneration and implant stabilization under OVX conditions.

TI  - Influence of different drilling preparation on cortical bone: A biomechanical,
      histological, and micro-CT study on sheep.
PG  - 707-715
LID - 10.1111/clr.13262 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the extent of cortical bone
      remodeling between two different drilling protocols by means of
      histomorphometric, micro-CT, and biomechanical analyses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 
      total of 48 implants were inserted into the mandible of six sheep following two
      drilling protocols: Group A (Test, n = 24), undersized preparation; Group B
      (Control, n = 24), non-undersized preparation. The animals were euthanatized to
      obtain 5 and 10 weeks of implantation time. Removal torque (RTQ) was measured on 
      12 implants of each group and the peri-implant bone was micro-CT scanned. Bone
      volume density (BV/TV) was calculated in pre-determined cylindrical volumes, up
      to 1.5 mm from implant surface. Non-decalcified histology was prepared on the
      remaining 12 implants from each group, where total bone-to-implant contact
      (totBIC) and newly-formed BIC (newBIC) was measured. Bone Area Fraction Occupancy
      (BAFO) was determined in pre-determined areas up to 1.5 mm from implant surface. 
      Paired sample t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to investigate
      differences between the groups. RESULTS: Group A presented significantly
      increased RTQ value at 5 weeks, while no difference was observed at 10 weeks.
      Group B presented increased BV/TV value at 5 weeks. Both groups showed comparable
      values for totBIC at both time-points. However, Group A presented significantly
      lower newBIC at 5 weeks. Higher BAFO was observed in Group B at 5 weeks.
      CONCLUSIONS: Implants inserted into undersized sites has an increased
      biomechanical performance, but provoked major remodeling of the cortical bone
      during the early healing period compared to non-undersized preparations. After 10
      weeks, no difference was observed.

AB  - Implant restoration has become one of the most regular methods of restoring
      dentition defect or edentulous. Implant placement and osseointegration are partly
      unreserved (fracture, implant is not in the correct three-dimensional position
      and cannot be repaired, peri-implantitis-affected nonmobile implants) need to be 
      removed. This article reviews the different methods of removing implants and
      discusses the limitations of each method, as well as the complications that may
      occur during the procedure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the
      osteogenic action of implants and the maturation and reconstruction changes in
      bone tissues in the early stage of osseointegration. METHODS: The mouse implant
      model was established by placing titanium in the femoral head of the mouse and
      locally injecting NGF in the implant zone. On 1, 2 and 4 weeks after operation,
      stain samples were collected from animals using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining
      and Masson staining. The effect of NGF on the bone maturation was compared at
      different time points of early stage osseointegration. RESULTS: The results of HE
      and Masson staining indicated that the local injection of external NGF can
      up-regulate bone mass, amount of bone trabecula, and bone maturity in the mouse
      model. The mature bone rate in treatment group of 1 week and 4 weeks after
      operation were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: NGF can shorten the period of bone maturation.

TI  - Combined effect of parathyroid hormone and strontium ranelate on bone healing in 
      ovariectomized rats.
PG  - 1255-1269
LID - 10.1111/odi.12895 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) enhances bone healing. Strontium ranelate
      (SR) is an antiresorptive agent that increases bone formation. Reports about
      combined effects of PTH and SR on local bone regeneration in osteoporotic
      subjects are limited. We aimed at investigating the efficacy of PTH and SR for
      promoting new bone formation in critical-sized defects of ovariectomized rats.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Parathyroid hormone- and/or SR-containing poloxamer
      implant tablets with/without chitosan microparticles were delivered locally to
      calvarial defects of 90 Wistar rats. Biopsies were analyzed histologically and
      histomorphometrically at 4 and 8 weeks of healing. RESULTS: Histomorphometry
      revealed that PTH alone promoted new bone formation at 4 weeks but the efficiency
      declined in 8 weeks. There was no positive effect of SR alone on bone formation
      at 4 or 8 weeks. Calvarial defects treated with PTH+SR combinations showed
      statistically significant greater new bone formation than either treatment alone 
      at both time intervals. Tissue responses were modest and supported the good
      biocompatibility of the biomaterials used. CONCLUSION: Parathyroid hormone and SR
      combinations can be effective for calvarial bone regeneration of ovariectomized
      rats. PTH plus SR may have potential use as bone graft material in orthopedic and
      dental surgery to enhance bone healing and osseointegration.

AB  - Superior mechanical and chemical properties of Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 bulk metallic glass
      (BMG) demonstrate its promise as a novel biomaterial for fabrication of implants.
      The aim of the present study was to validate mechanical, chemical, and biological
      properties of Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG through comparison with titanium (Ti). Our data 
      indicated higher tensile strength, lower Young's modulus, and reduced metal ion
      release of Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG compared with Ti. Biosafety of bone marrow
      mesenchymal cells on Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG was comparable to that of Ti. Next,
      screw-type implant prototypes made of Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG were fabricated and
      inserted into rat long bones. Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG implants indicated a higher
      removal-torque value and lower Periotest value compared with Ti implants. In
      addition, higher amounts of new bone formation and osseointegration were observed
      around Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG implants compared with Ti implants. Moreover, gene
      expression analysis displayed higher expression of osteoblast- and
      osteoclast-associated genes in the Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG group compared with the Ti 
      group. Importantly, loading to implants upregulated bone formation, as well as
      osteoblast- and osteoclast-associated gene expression in the peri-implant area.
      No significant difference in concentrations of Ni, Al, Cu, and Zr in various
      organs was shown between in the Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG and Ti groups. Collectively,
      these findings suggest that Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG is suitable for fabricating novel 
      implants with superior mechanical properties, biocompatibility, stability, and
      biosafety compared with Ti. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Titanium is widely used to
      fabricate orthopedic and dental implants. However, Titanium has disadvantages for
      biomedical applications in regard to strength, elasticity, and biosafety.
      Recently, we developed a novel hypoeutectic Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG, which has
      superior mechanical and chemical properties. However, the validity of
      Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG for biomedical application has not been cleared. The aim of
      the present study was to validate the mechanical, chemical, and biological
      properties of Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG for biomedical applications through comparison
      with Titanium. The present study clarifies that Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG has good
      mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and osteogenic activity, which are
      necessary features for biomedical applications. The present study provides for
      the first time the superiority of Zr70Ni16Cu6Al8 BMG implants to Titanium
      implants for biomedical applications.

PG  - 1229-1235
LID - 10.1177/0022034518772283 [doi]
AB  - This study compared the osteogenic potential of bone marrow mesenchymal stem
      cells (BMSCs) of iliac and alveolar origins (I-BMSCs and Al-BMSCs, respectively),
      which were transplanted in combination with beta tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) 
      in peri-implant bone defects to investigate the osseointegration between dental
      implants and tissue-engineered bone in dogs. Specifically, I-BMSCs and Al-BMSCs
      were cultured, characterized, and seeded on beta-TCP and subjected to
      immunoblotting analyses and alkaline phosphatase activity assays. Subsequently,
      these cell-seeded scaffolds were implanted into defects that were freshly
      generated in the mandibular premolar areas of 4 dogs. The defects were covered
      with beta-TCP + Al-BMSCs ( n = 6), beta-TCP + I-BMSCs ( n = 6), or beta-TCP ( n =
      6) or served as the blank control ( n = 6). After healing for 12 wk, the
      formation and mineralization of new bones were assessed through micro-computed
      tomographic, histologic, and histomorphometric analyses, and bone-to-implant
      contacts were measured in the specimens. It was evident that in this large animal
      model, I-BMSCs and Al-BMSCs manifested similarly strong osteogenic potential, as 
      significantly more new bone was formed in the Al-BMSC and I-BMSC groups than
      otherwise ( P < 0.01). Therefore, Al-BMSCs are emerging as an efficient
      alternative for autologous mesenchymal stem cells in regenerative dental and
      maxillofacial therapies. I-BMSCs, if not restricted in their bioavailability, can
      also be of great utility in bone tissue-engineering applications.

TI  - Vitamin E Phosphate Coating Stimulates Bone Deposition in Implant-related
      Infections in a Rat Model.
PG  - 1324-1338
LID - 10.1097/01.blo.0000534692.41467.02 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implant-related infections are associated with impaired bone healing 
      and osseointegration. In vitro antiadhesive and antibacterial properties and in
      vivo antiinflammatory effects protecting against bone loss of various
      formulations of vitamin E have been demonstrated in animal models. However, to
      the best of our knowledge, no in vivo studies have demonstrated the synergistic
      activity of vitamin E in preventing bacterial adhesion to orthopaedic implants,
      thus supporting the bone-implant integration. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of 
      this study was to test whether a vitamin E phosphate coating on titanium implants
      may be able to reduce (1) the bacterial colonization of prosthetic implants and
      (2) bone resorption and osteomyelitis in a rat model of Staphylococcus
      aureus-induced implant-related infection. METHODS: Twelve rats were bilaterally
      injected in the femurs with S aureus UAMS-1-Xen40 and implanted with uncoated or 
      vitamin E phosphate-coated titanium Kirschner wires without local or systemic
      antibiotic prophylaxis. Eight rats represented the uninfected control group. A
      few hours after surgery, two control and three infected animals died as a result 
      of unexpected complications. With the remaining rats, we assessed the presence of
      bacterial contamination with qualitative bioluminescence imaging and
      Gram-positive staining and with quantitative bacterial count. Bone changes in
      terms of resorption and osteomyelitis were quantitatively analyzed through
      micro-CT (bone mineral density) and semiquantitatively through histologic scoring
      systems. RESULTS: Six weeks after implantation, we found only a mild decrease in 
      bacterial count in coated versus uncoated implants (Ti versus controls: mean
      difference [MD], -3.705; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.416 to -2.994; p <
      0.001; TiVE versus controls: MD, -3.063; 95% CI, -3.672 to -2.454; p < 0.001),
      whereas micro-CT analysis showed a higher bone mineral density at the knee and
      femoral metaphysis in the vitamin E-treated group compared with uncoated implants
      (knee joint: MD, -11.88; 95% CI, -16.100 to -7.664; p < 0.001 and femoral
      metaphysis: MD, -19.87; 95% CI, -28.82 to -10.93; p < 0.001). We found decreased 
      osteonecrosis (difference between medians, 1.5; 95% CI, 1-2; p < 0.002) in the
      infected group receiving the vitamin E-coated nails compared with the uncoated
      nails. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings indicate that vitamin E phosphate 
      implant coatings can exert a protective effect on bone deposition in a highly
      contaminated animal model of implant-related infection. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The
      use of vitamin E coatings may open new perspectives for developing coatings that 
      can limit septic loosening of infected implants with bacterial contamination.
      However, a deeper insight into the mechanism of action and the local release of
      vitamin E as a coating for orthopaedic implants is required to be used in clinics
      in the near future. Although this study cannot support the antimicrobial
      properties of vitamin E, promising results were obtained for bone-implant
      osseointegration. These preliminary results will require further in vivo
      investigations to optimize the host response in the presence of antibiotic
      prophylaxis.

      quantitative ultrasound technique and resonance frequency analysis.
PG  - 470-478
LID - 10.1111/cid.12622 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resonance frequency analyses and quantitative ultrasound methods have
      been suggested to assess dental implant primary stability. PURPOSE: The purpose
      of this study was to compare the results obtained using these two techniques
      applied to the same dental implants inserted in various bone phantoms. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Different values of trabecular bone density and cortical thickness
      were considered to assess the effect of bone quality on the respective indicators
      (UI and ISQ). The effect of the implant insertion depth and of the final drill
      diameter was also investigated. RESULTS: ISQ values increase and UI values
      decrease as a function of trabecular density, cortical thickness and the screwing
      of the implant. When the implant diameter varies, the UI values are significantly
      different for all final drill diameters (except for two), while the ISQ values
      are similar for all final drill diameters lower than 3.2 mm and higher than 3.3
      mm. The error on the estimation of parameters with the QUS device is between 4
      and 8 times lower compared to that made with the RFA technique. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results show that ultrasound technique provides a better estimation of different 
      parameters related to the implant stability compared to the RFA technique.

TI  - The relationship between substrate morphology and biological performances of
      nano-silver-loaded dopamine coatings on titanium surfaces.
PG  - 172310
LID - 10.1098/rsos.172310 [doi]
AB  - Biomedical device-associated infection (BAI) and lack of osseointegration are the
      main causes of implant failure. Therefore, it is imperative for implants not only
      to depress microbial activity and biofilm colonization but also to prompt
      osteoblast functions and osseointegration. As part of the coating development for
      implants, the interest of in vitro studies on the interaction between implant
      substrate morphology and the coating's biological performances is growing. In
      this study, by harnessing the adhesion and reactivity of bioinspired
      polydopamine, nano-silver was successfully anchored onto micro/nanoporous as well
      as smooth titanium surfaces to analyse the effect of substrate morphology on
      biological performances of the coatings. Compared with the smooth surface, a
      small size of nano-silver and high silver content was found on the
      micro/nanoporous surface. More mineralization happened on the coating on the
      micro/nanoporous structure than on the smooth surface, which led to a more rapid 
      decrease of silver release from the micro/nanoporous surface. Antimicrobial tests
      indicated that both surfaces with resulting coating inhibit microbial
      colonization on them and growth around them, indicating that the coating
      eliminates the shortcoming of the porous structure which render the implant
      extremely susceptible to BAI. Besides, the multiple osteoblast responses of
      nano-silver-loaded dopamine coatings on both surfaces, i.e. attachment,
      proliferation and differentiation, have deteriorated, however the mineralized
      surfaces of these coatings stimulated osteoblast proliferation and
      differentiation, especially for the micro/nanoporous surface. Therefore,
      nano-silver-loaded dopamine coatings on micro/nanoporous substratum may not only 
      reduce the risk of infection but also facilitate mineralization during the early 
      post-operative period and then promote osseointegration owing to the good
      osteoblast-biocompatibility of the mineralized surface. These results clearly
      highlight the influence of the substrate morphology on the biological
      performances of implant coating.

TI  - Effect of Avocado/Soybean Unsaponifiables (ASU) on Osseointegration in Rats with 
      Experimental Arthritis.
PG  - 603-612
LID - 10.11607/jomi.6124 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of the use of avocado/soybean unsaponifiables 
      (ASU) on osseointegration of implants in animals with experimental arthritis.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty rats were randomly divided into four
      groups: CTR, healthy animals and saline solution administration; ASU, healthy
      animals and ASU administration; ART, arthritic animals and saline solution
      administration; and ART/ASU, arthritic animals and ASU administration. The
      solutions were administered daily by gavage, beginning 7 days before the surgical
      procedures until the completion of the experimental period (15, 30, and 60 days
      after the placement of the implants in the tibia). The osseointegration of the
      implants was evaluated by histometric analysis (bone-to-implant contact [% BIC], 
      bone area between the threads [% BBT]) and biomechanical analysis. Microcomputed 
      tomography (micro-CT) analysis was used to assess bone volume in the vicinity of 
      the implant. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to assess the expression
      of osteocalcin and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1). RESULTS: The
      ART/ASU group showed a decreased percentage of bone in the area around the
      implant compared with the ASU and ART groups (15 and 30 days). The ART/ASU group 
      showed increased removal torque values (30 days) and % BIC and % BBT (30 to 60
      days) compared with the ART group. The ASU group had increased % BIC values
      compared with the ART and CTR groups (60 days). The CTR group had the highest
      expression of osteocalcin, while the ASU group presented the highest expression
      of TGF-beta1 at 60 days. CONCLUSION: The ASU administration improved the
      osseointegration, particularly in animals with induced arthritis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare in vivo Titanium Alloy (TiA) with Stainless Steel (SS)
      miniscrews Temporary Anchorage Devices (TADs) using removal torque and Scanning
      Electron Microscopic (SEM) analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 15 subjects (6 males
      and 9 females) who required maximum anchorage were recruited. For each patient, a
      TiA TAD and a SS TAD with same length and width were implanted following a
      randomized split-mouth study design. Retraction was carried out with
      nickel-titanium spring ligated directly from the anterior hooks of the archwire
      to the TADs to produce 90 to 100 g of force. When no further anchorage
      supplementation was needed, the TADs were removed. The removal torque values were
      registered with a digital screwdriver. After removal, the TADs were collected in 
      a fixed solution and examined using SEM and X-ray microanalysis. RESULTS: All
      TADs remained intact, with a 100% success rate. There was no difference in
      removal torque between TiA and SS miniscrews (4.4 +/- 1.3 N-cm and 5.1 +/- 0.7
      N-cm, respectively). All specimens' loss of gloss with signs of biological
      contaminations resulted in a dull implant surface. SEM photomicrographs of TiA
      miniscrews showed predominantly blood cells while SS miniscrews showed the
      precipitation of an amorphous layer with low cellular component. There was no
      difference in spectroscopic analysis between TiA and SS miniscrews. CONCLUSIONS: 
      TiA and SS miniscrews had comparable removal torque values. SEM photomicrographs 
      showed no evidence of osseointegration with both TADs having similar biological
      responses.

TI  - Splinted and unsplinted overdenture attachment systems: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 647-656
LID - 10.1111/joor.12651 [doi]
AB  - Splinted and unsplinted overdenture attachment systems have unique advantages and
      disadvantages. The aim of the present systematic review was to determine the
      influence of splinted and unsplinted overdenture attachment systems on the
      marginal bone loss, prosthetic complications and implant survival rate.
      PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and Cochrane databases were searched for articles
      published up to October 2017, using the following search terms: "overdenture AND 
      attachment OR overdenture AND bar OR overdenture splinted." The PICO question "Do
      splinted overdenture attachment systems promote better clinical results in
      comparison to unsplinted systems?" was evaluated. Eligible studies included
      randomized controlled clinical trials, prospective studies with at least 10
      participants and a minimum follow-up of 6 months, and studies published in
      English that compared splinted and unsplinted attachment systems within the same 
      study. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was considered for all outcomes analysed.
      After completion of the different steps in the article selection process, nine
      articles were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. A total of
      984 implants were placed in 380 patients (mean age: 62.8 years). The
      meta-analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences between
      splinted and unsplinted attachment systems with regard to marginal bone loss (P =
      .39; MD: -0.11; 95% CI: -0.37 to 0.14), complications (P = .31; RR: 1.26; CI:
      0.80-1.99) and implant survival rate (P = .14; RR: 0.37% CI: 0.10-1.36). In
      addition, splinted and unsplinted overdenture attachment systems achieved similar
      results with regard to marginal bone loss, prosthetic complications and implant
      survival rate.

TI  - Stability of tapered and parallel-walled dental implants: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 634-645
LID - 10.1111/cid.12623 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have suggested that dental implants with a tapered
      configuration have improved stability at placement, allowing immediate placement 
      and/or loading. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to
      evaluate the implant stability of tapered dental implants compared to standard
      parallel-walled dental implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Applying the guidelines
      of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)
      statement, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched for in electronic
      databases and complemented by hand searching. The risk of bias was assessed using
      the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool and data were analyzed using
      statistical software. RESULTS: A total of 1199 studies were identified, of which,
      five trials were included with 336 dental implants in 303 participants. Overall
      meta-analysis showed that tapered dental implants had higher implant stability
      values than parallel-walled dental implants at insertion and 8 weeks but the
      difference was not statistically significant. Tapered dental implants had
      significantly less marginal bone loss compared to parallel-walled dental
      implants. No significant differences in implant failure rate were found between
      tapered and parallel-walled dental implants. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited
      evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of tapered dental implants in achieving
      greater implant stability compared to parallel-walled dental implants. Superior
      short-term results in maintaining peri-implant marginal bone with tapered dental 
      implants are possible. Further properly designed RCTs are required to endorse the
      supposed advantages of tapered dental implants in immediate loading protocol and 
      other complex clinical scenarios.

TI  - Nanostructured Ag(+)-substituted fluorhydroxyapatite-TiO2 coatings for enhanced
      bactericidal effects and osteoinductivity of Ti for biomedical applications.
PG  - 2665-2684
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S162558 [doi]
AB  - Background: Poor mechanical properties, undesirable fast dissolution rate, and
      lack of antibacterial activity limit the application of hydroxyapatite (HA) as an
      implant coating material. To overcome these limitations, a hybrid coating of
      Ag(+)-substituted fluorhydroxyapatite and titania nanotube (TNT) was prepared.
      Methods: The incorporation of silver into the HA-TiO2 hybrid coating improves its
      antimicrobial properties. The addition of F as a second binary element increases 
      the structural stability of the coating. The TNT/F-and-Ag-substituted HA (FAgHA) 
      bilayer coating on the Ti substrate was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, scanning 
      electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray
      photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results: The results indicate that the
      FAgHA/TNT nanocomposite coating has a dense and uniform morphology with a
      nano-rod-like structure. The solubility measurement result shows that the
      substitution of F(-) ions into the AgHA structure has a positive effect on the
      dissolution resistance of HA. The adhesion strength of FAgHA/TNT has
      significantly increased because of the interlocking of the roughened surface with
      nano-rod-like particles that entered into the voids of the TiO2 nanotubes.
      Compared with that of the bare Ti, the corrosion current density of
      FAgHA/TNT-coated Ti substrate decreased from 3.71 to 0.18 muA, and its corrosion 
      resistance increased by almost two orders of magnitude. Moreover, despite pure
      HA, the FAgHA killed all viable Staphylococcus aureus after 24 hours of
      incubation. Although the fabricated FAgHA/TNT coating is hydrophobic, it induced 
      deposition of the typical spherical apatite when immersed in a simulated body
      fluid (SBF); the osteoblasts spread very well on the surface of the coating. In
      addition, in vitro cell culture tests demonstrated cell viability and alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP) similar to pure HA, which indicated good cytocompatibility.
      Interestingly, compared with bare Ti, FAgHA/TNT-coated Ti surface was innocent
      for cell vitality and even more beneficial for cell osteogenesis in vitro.
      Conclusion: Enhancing the osseointegration and preventing infection in implants, 
      the FAgHA/TNT-coated Ti makes implants more successful.

TI  - Sinus augmentation using rhBMP-2/ACS in a mini-pig model: Influence of an
      adjunctive ceramic bone biomaterial.
PG  - 1005-1013
LID - 10.1111/jcpe.12921 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 in an absorbable
      collagen sponge carrier (rhBMP-2/ACS) has been shown to support significant bone 
      formation when used to augment the maxillary sinus for implant dentistry.
      Nevertheless, bone biomaterials have been suggested to extend rhBMP-2/ACS with
      limited support of the merits of such approaches. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate local
      bone formation/dental implant osseointegration following implantation of
      rhBMP-2/ACS combined with a ceramic bone biomaterial using a mini-pig sinus
      augmentation model. METHODS: Twelve adult Gottingen mini-pigs received
      rhBMP-2/ACS (rhBMP-2 adjusted to 0.43 mg/cc) alone or combined with an
      off-the-shelf biphasic ceramic (15%/85% HA/ss-TCP) biomaterial at 3:1, 1:1 and
      1:3 ratios randomized to contra-lateral maxillary sinus sites yielding
      rhBMP-2/ACS fractions of 100%, 75%, 50% and 25%, respectively. A 4-cc implant
      volume was used for all sites. Two threaded dental implants (o4.0 x 11.5 mm) were
      placed at each site. The animals were euthanized at 8 weeks for histologic
      analysis. RESULTS: Surgical execution and healing were generally uneventful,
      infraorbital local swelling was observed in all animals until suture removal.
      rhBMP-2/ACS combined with the ceramic biomaterial did not significantly enhance
      local bone formation (range 9.0 +/- 1.5 to 9.7 +/- 2.1 mm) compared with
      rhBMP-2/ACS alone (8.6 +/- 1.1 mm; p > 0.05). Variations in rhBMP-2/ACS to
      ceramic matrix ratios yielding rhBMP-2 doses approximating 0.4, 0.9, 1.3 and 1.7 
      mg/sinus did not appreciably influence bone formation/osseointegration.
      CONCLUSIONS: Whereas rhBMP-2/ACS supports significant bone
      formation/osseointegration in the mini-pig sinus augmentation model and thus
      appears an effective alternative for sinus augmentation procedures, adding a
      ceramic biomaterial to rhBMP-2/ACS does not produce meaningful biological
      advantages.

AB  - Patients with compromised bone conditions still suffer the problem of deficient
      osseointegration during dental implant treatment. Developing mesenchymal stem
      cell (MSC) sheet functionalized titanium implant with proper inductive cue to
      promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis coupling shall be a good solution. In the
      present study, the antimiR-138 delivered MSC sheet is used to functionalize the
      Ti implant. The cell sheet can well integrate with the Ti implant to form the MSC
      sheet-implant complex (MSIC). The antimiR-138 delivered MSIC shows greatly
      improved osteogenesis and angiogenesis coupling both in vitro and in vivo. In
      vitro, the antimiR-138 delivered MSIC significantly promotes the expression of
      endogenous osteogenesis and angiogenesis related genes and proteins, alkaline
      phosphatase activity, extracellular matrix mineralization and collagen secretion 
      compared to the antimiR-control and the nothing delivered control. The in vivo
      ectopic implantation assay uncovers the robust vascularized bone formation of the

AB  - Low bone quality may compromise the success of cementless total hip arthroplasty 
      in high-risk patients such as elderly women. Zoledronic acid is a long-lasting
      antiresorptive agent, which is known to reduce short-term periprosthetic bone
      loss. However, its effect on femoral stem stability is not well known. Forty-nine
      female patients with a mean age of 68years (range, 51-85years) scheduled to
      undergo cementless total hip arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis were randomized
      in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to receive a single postoperative 
      infusion of zoledronic acid or placebo. Patients were evaluated for up to four
      years postoperatively for femoral stem migration measured by radiostereometric
      analysis, bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry,
      functional recovery, and patient-reported outcome scores. Implant survival was
      determined at nine years postoperatively. Zoledronic acid did not reduce the
      femoral stem migration that occurred predominantly during the settling period of 
      the first 3-6months. Subsequently, all femoral stems were radiographically
      osseointegrated. Zoledronic acid maintained periprosthetic BMD, while the
      expected loss of periprosthetic bone during the first 12months was found in
      controls. Thereafter, periprosthetic BMD of Gruen zone 7 decreased even in the
      zoledronic acid group but remained 14.6% higher than that in the placebo group at
      four years postoperatively. Functional recovery was comparable across the groups.
      At nine years postoperatively, no revision arthroplasty had been performed. In
      conclusion, in women at high-risk for low BMD, zoledronic acid had a
      long-lasting, partially protective effect on periprosthetic bone loss, but the
      treatment did not enhance the initial femoral stem stability.

TI  - A review of nanostructured surfaces and materials for dental implants: surface
      coating, patterning and functionalization for improved performance.
PG  - 1312-1338
LID - 10.1039/c8bm00021b [doi]
AB  - The emerging field of nanostructured implants has enormous scope in the areas of 
      medical science and dental implants. Surface nanofeatures provide significant
      potential solutions to medical problems by the introduction of better
      biomaterials, improved implant design, and surface engineering techniques such as
      coating, patterning, functionalization and molecular grafting at the nanoscale.
      This review is of an interdisciplinary nature, addressing the history and
      development of dental implants and the emerging area of nanotechnology in dental 
      implants. After a brief introduction to nanotechnology in dental implants and the
      main classes of dental implants, an overview of different types of nanomaterials 
      (i.e. metals, metal oxides, ceramics, polymers and hydrides) used in dental
      implant together with their unique properties, the influence of elemental
      compositions, and surface morphologies and possible applications are presented
      from a chemical point of view. In the core of this review, the dental implant
      materials, physical and chemical fabrication techniques and the role of
      nanotechnology in achieving ideal dental implants have been discussed. Finally,
      the critical parameters in dental implant design and available data on the
      current dental implant surfaces that use nanotopography in clinical dentistry
      have been discussed.

TI  - Comparative analysis of osseointegration in various types of acetabular implant
      materials.
PG  - 622-628
LID - 10.1177/1120700018759314 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of comparative data on osseointegration (BIC) of
      acetabular cup surfaces in hip arthroplasty in both normal bone mineral density
      and in conditions of osteoporosis. AIM: To compare osseointegration of acetabular
      implants with various types of surfaces in an animal model with normal and
      osteoporotic bone tissue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed on 60
      rats. To simulate osteoporosis ovariectomy was performed in 30 animals. Thirty
      healthy rats served as controls. In standardised defects of the distal
      metadiaphysis of the femur we implanted: porous tantalum Trabecular Metal (A),
      Trabecular Titanium (B), Titanium with Gription coating (C), Stiktite (D), and
      Tritanum (E). Bone apposition (osseointegration) was defined as all areas of
      direct "bone-to-implant contact" (BIC). RESULTS: No qualitative morphological
      differences in the evaluation of BIC around different implant types was seen in
      normal rats and rats with osteoporosis. Connective tissue areas around implants
      were larger in rats with osteoporosis. Morphometric studies showed that the
      highest BIC were seen in implants A and B, both in healthy animals ([72.00 +/-
      3.48]% and [67.46 +/- 1.69]%) and ones with osteoporosis ([59.19 +/- 2.10]% and
      [53.36 +/- 2.57]%). BIC was (60.10 +/- 2.05)%, (60.26 +/- 2.36)%, and (61.78 +/- 
      2.27)% around implants C, D and E in healthy rats, respectively. BIC in
      osteoporosis was (45.39 +/- 2.37)%, (47.81 +/- 2.41)% and (42.10 +/- 1.44)%,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the evaluated implants have good 
      BIC features. Furthermore, based on histomorthometry and histology, Porous
      tantalum Trabecular Metal (A) and Trabecular Titanium (B) implants exhibit higher
      BIC with bone tissue.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of Cell Viability Immediately After Osteotomy for Implants
      With Drills and Piezosurgery: Immunohistochemistry Analysis.
PG  - 1578-1582
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000004542 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of reusing drills and piezosurgery tips during 
      implant osteotomy on immediate bone cell viability through immunohistochemical
      analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six male rabbits were divided into 2 groups and 
      then divided into 5 subgroups-correspond to drills and tips used 10, 20, 30, 40, 
      and 50 times, respectively. All animals received 10 osteotomies in each tibia, by
      use of the classic drilling procedure in one group (G1) and the piezosurgery
      device in the other group (G2). For immunohistochemical technique were utilized
      the osteoprotegerin, RANKL, osteocalcin, and caspase 3. Control procedures were
      performed by omitting the primary antibodies (negative control). RESULTS: Bone
      formation and resorption responses presented in more intense way during the
      piezosurgery. The expression of osteocalcin had become quite intense in
      piezosurgery groups, but with reduced immunostaining from the 30th osteotomy. The
      caspase 3 showed the viability of the osteoblast from the 20th osteotomy with
      piezosurgery and remained constant until the 50th. CONCLUSION: Piezosurgery
      provides greater osteoblastic cell viability than the system of conventional
      drilling. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study will provide data so that the authors
      can recycle the drills and tips for implant placement, thus enabling a better
      cell viability for osseointegration.

TI  - Case Studies in Neuroscience: Sensations elicited and discrimination ability from
      nerve cuff stimulation in an amputee over time.
PG  - 291-295
LID - 10.1152/jn.00909.2017 [doi]
AB  - The present case study details sensations elicited by electrical stimulation of
      peripheral nerve axons using an implanted nerve cuff electrode, in a participant 
      with a transhumeral amputation. The participant uses an osseointegrated
      electromechanical interface, which enables skeletal attachment of the prosthesis 
      and long-term, stable, bidirectional communication between the implanted
      electrodes and prosthetic arm. We focused on evoking somatosensory percepts,
      where we tracked and quantified the evolution of perceived sensations in the
      missing hand, which were evoked from electrical stimulation of the nerve, for
      over 2 yr. These sensations included small, pointlike areas of either vibration
      or pushing, to larger sensations over wider areas, indicating the recruitment of 
      a few and many afferents, respectively. Furthermore, we used a two-alternative
      forced choice paradigm to measure the level of discrimination between trains of
      brief electrical stimuli, to gauge what the participant could reliably
      distinguish between. At best, the participant was able to distinguish a 0.5-Hz
      difference and on average acquired a 3.8-Hz just-noticeable difference at a more 
      stringent psychophysical level. The current work shows the feasibility for
      long-term sensory feedback in prostheses, via electrical axonal stimulation,
      where small and relatively stable percepts were felt that may be used to deliver 
      graded sensory feedback. This opens up opportunities for signaling feedback
      during movements (e.g., for precision grip), but also for conveying more complex 
      cutaneous sensations, such as texture. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We demonstrate the
      long-term stability and generation of sensations from electrical peripheral nerve
      stimulation in an amputee, through an osseointegrated implant. We find that
      perceived tactilelike sensations could be generated for over 2 yr, in the missing
      hand. This is useful for prosthetic development and the implementation of
      feedback in artificial body parts.

TI  - A multiscale analytical approach to evaluate osseointegration.

LID - 10.1007/s10856-018-6068-y [doi]
AB  - Osseointegrated implants are frequently used in reconstructive surgery, both in
      the dental and orthopedic field, restoring physical function and improving the
      quality of life for the patients. The bone anchorage is typically evaluated at
      micrometer resolution, while bone tissue is a dynamic composite material composed
      of nanoscale collagen fibrils and apatite crystals, with defined hierarchical
      levels at different length scales. In order to understand the bone formation and 
      the ultrastructure of the interfacial tissue, analytical strategies needs to be
      implemented enabling multiscale and multimodal analyses of the intact interface. 
      This paper describes a sample preparation route for successive analyses allowing 
      assessment of the different hierarchical levels of interest, going from macro to 
      nano scale and could be implemented on single samples. Examples of resulting
      analyses of different techniques on one type of implant surface is given, with
      emphasis on correlating the length scale between the different techniques. The
      bone-implant interface shows an intimate contact between mineralized collagen
      bundles and the outermost surface of the oxide layer, while bone mineral is found
      in the nanoscale surface features creating a functionally graded interface.
      Osteocytes exhibit a direct contact with the implant surface via canaliculi that 
      house their dendritic processes. Blood vessels are frequently found in close
      proximity to the implant surface either within the mineralized bone matrix or at 
      regions of remodeling.

TI  - Incidental finding of a degrading zirconia dental implant 29 months after
      implantation: Histological and histomorphometrical analysis.
PG  - 2919-2923
LID - 10.1002/jbm.b.34152 [doi]
AB  - With the emerging development and improvement of biomaterials, the application of
      ceramics in restorative medicine has experienced a renaissance. New production
      processes have reportedly helped to overcome unfavorable biomechanical
      characteristics of these materials, which lead to a wide application of zirconia 
      as ground material for dental implants. Zirconia-based implants are
      biocompatible, demonstrate ability to osseointegrate and have a teeth-like color,
      rendering them to be an ideal replacement for titanium-based implant systems,
      which represent the current gold standard in implantology. However, there is a
      lack of standardized guidelines on production of zirconia-based implants and
      long-term studies on the stability of this material in vivo are missing. In this 
      study we demonstrate for the first time the accumulation of degradation products 
      of a commercially available one-piece zirconia-based dental implant 29 months
      after implantation, which was recovered following a traumatic accident. Biopsy
      specimens from the implant and the surrounding tissue attached to it were
      processed for histological and histomorphometrical analysis. Although the implant
      was well integrated into the anchoring bone, degradation particles were observed 
      in tissues adjacent to lower aspects of the implant. The observed implant
      degradation might seriously compromise implant stability several years after
      implantation. This incidental finding highlights the requirement of further
      research on zirconia-based ceramics before they can be advertised as safe
      alternative to titanium-based implant systems. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

TI  - Qualitative Assessment of Reliability of Cone-beam Computed Tomography in
      evaluating Bone Density at Posterior Mandibular Implant Site.
PG  - 426-430
AB  - Introduction: The success of dental implants depends primarily on the primary
      implant stability and the bone density so that predictable osseointegration can
      be achieved. To achieve the desired results, systematic preoperative planning for
      implant placement is required. The sole aim of the study was to assess the
      reliability of preoperative bone density of mandibular posterior region for
      implant placement using computerized tomography-derived bone densities in
      Hounsfield units (HU). Materials and methods: A total of 200 patients with 352
      implant sites between 2014 and 2017 were assessed for the posterior mandibular
      area using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Evaluation was done by two
      experienced observers independently. Results: The mean bone density of males was 
      690.5 +/- 104.12 HU and in females, it was 580.20 +/- 120.2 HU. Overall, 21% of
      sites were of low bone density, 39.5% were of intermediate density, and 39.4%
      were of high density. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis presented 
      that the CBCT intensity values had a high predictive power for predicting both
      high-density sites and intermediate-density sites. Conclusion: We can say from
      our results that, for predicting the bone densities in posterior mandible for
      determining implant sites, so as to achieve best osseointegration, CBCT values
      can be reliably used. Clinical significance: It has been proved that bone density
      and implant stability are dependent on each other and osseointegration is
      important for the success of treatment. With advancements in dentistry and
      introduction of CBCT, treatment planning and prediction of appropriate implant
      sites could be made easy and more predictable. Thus, we can say that CBCT can be 
      considered an alternative diagnostic tool for the bone density evaluation during 
      treatment planning for implant placement. Keywords: Bone density, Cone-beam
      computed tomography, Implants, Osseointegration.

TI  - Risk of bias assessment of systematic reviews regarding dental implant placement 
      in smokers: An umbrella systematic review.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Although dental implant treatment has a high success rate, 
      patient-related factors may cause implant failure. In this context, smoking is
      associated with adverse effects on implant osseointegration. In spite of
      systematic reviews addressing this topic, the risk of bias in these reviews must 
      be assessed to inform readers whether the studies were conducted with
      methodological rigor and whether their recommendations are viable in daily
      clinical practice. PURPOSE: The purpose of this umbrella systematic review was to
      assess the risk of bias of systematic reviews regarding dental implant placement 
      in smokers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic review articles with meta-analysis
      regarding dental implant placement in smokers were eligible for this study. The
      following were excluded: articles in which implant survival or failure rate was
      not the primary outcome; articles in which implant survival or failure rate was
      not related to smokers; and duplicated articles. The search was performed by 2
      independent reviewers on MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS,
      DARE-Cochrane, and SIGLE via OpenGrey. Non-peer-reviewed literature was sought on
      SIGLE via OpenGrey without language restrictions. Reviewers read titles and/or
      abstracts to select potential eligible studies, and articles initially selected
      were read fully. A third reviewer was consulted in cases of disagreement.
      References of the selected articles were also screened to identify articles of
      potential interest. The last search was performed on April 29, 2017. Risk of bias
      assessment was performed with the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS)
      tool. RESULTS: Of the initial 2539 results, 6 systematic reviews with
      meta-analysis were eligible for the umbrella review (kappa=0.90; very good
      agreement). All studies were published in the last 11 years. One meta-analysis
      (16.7%) presented low risk of bias, 3 (50.0%) were assessed as of unclear risk of
      bias, and 2 (33.3%) received a score of high risk of bias according to the
      assessment with the ROBIS tool, which also indicated that the criteria most
      commonly not met were study eligibility criteria and identification and selection
      of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Five of the 6 included meta-analyses had a risk of bias 
      (high or unclear). Therefore, their conclusions and recommendations required
      careful review. Future meta-analyses must focus especially on study eligibility
      criteria and identification and selection of studies.

TI  - Comparison of Resonance Frequency Analysis and of Quantitative Ultrasound to
      Assess Dental Implant Osseointegration.
LID - E1397 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s18051397 [doi]
AB  - Dental implants are widely used in the clinic. However, there remain risks of
      failure, which depend on the implant stability. The aim of this paper is to
      compare two methods based on resonance frequency analysis (RFA) and on
      quantitative ultrasound (QUS) and that aim at assessing implant stability.
      Eighty-one identical dental implants were inserted in the iliac crests of 11
      sheep. The QUS and RFA measurements were realized after different healing times
      (0, 5, 7, and 15 weeks). The results obtained with the QUS (respectively RFA)
      method were significantly different when comparing two consecutive healing time
      for 97% (respectively, 18%) of the implants. The error made on the estimation of 
      the healing time when analyzing the results obtained with the QUS technique was
      around 10 times lower than that made when using the RFA technique. The results
      corresponding to the dependence of the ISQ versus healing time were significantly
      different when comparing two directions of RFA measurement. The results show that
      the QUS method allows a more accurate determination of the evolution of dental
      implant stability when compared to the RFA method. This study paves the way
      towards the development of a medical device, thus providing a decision support
      system to dental surgeons.

TI  - Micro/nano hierarchical structured titanium treated by NH4OH/H2O2 for enhancing
      cell response.
PG  - e0196366
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0196366 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, two kinds of titanium surfaces with novel micro/nano hierarchical 
      structures, namely Etched (E) surface and Sandblast and etched (SE) surface, were
      successfully fabricated by NH4OH and H2O2 mixture. And their cellular responses
      of MG63 were investigated compared with Sandblast and acid-etching (SLA) surface.
      Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Surface profiler, X-ray photoelectron
      spectroscopy (XPS), and Contact angle instrument were employed to assess the
      surface morphologies, roughness, chemistry and wettability respectively.
      Hierarchical structures with micro holes of 10-30 mum in diameter and nano pits
      of tens of nanometers in diameter formed on both E and SE surfaces. The size of
      micro holes is very close to osteoblast cell, which makes them wonderful beds for
      osteoblast. Moreover, these two kinds of surfaces possess similar roughness and
      superior hydrophilicity to SLA. Reactive oxygen species were detected on E and SE
      surface, and thus considerable antimicrobial performance and well fixation can be
      speculated on them. The cell experiments also demonstrated a boost in cell
      attachment, and that proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were achieved
      on them, especially on SE surface. The results indicate that the treatment of
      pure titanium with H2O2/NH4OH is an effective technique to improve the initial
      stability of implants and enhance the osseointegration, which may be a promising 
      surface treatment to titanium implant.

TI  - Antibiotic prescription for the prevention and treatment of postoperative
      complications after routine dental implant placement. A cross-sectional study
      performed in Spain.
PG  - e264-e270
LID - 10.4317/jced.54637 [doi]
AB  - Background: As there are no established guidelines for antibiotic prescription
      after dental implant placement a study was made to determine the current
      prescribing habits of several groups of practitioners regarding antibiotics to
      prevent and/or treat postoperative complications - early failures and infections 
      - in relation to routine dental implant placement. Material and Methods: An
      electronic survey was sent to postgraduate students and professionals with
      experience in routine dental implant placement who practice in Spain. The
      questions asked were related to whether antibiotics were routinely prescribed
      either pre- or postoperatively to prevent and/or treat postoperative
      complications during routine dental implant placement, and, if so, what
      antibiotics, dosage, frequency, and duration were used. Descriptive and bivariate
      analyses of the data were performed. Results: Two hundred and forty-seven
      responses were obtained. Preventively, 17 respondents (6.9%) prescribed
      antibiotics only preoperatively (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.7 to 10.0%), 100
      (40.5%) preferred to give them exclusively during the postoperative period (95%CI
      34.4 to 46.6%) and 94 practitioners (38.1%) prescribed antibiotics both pre- and 
      post-operatively (95%CI 32.0 to 44.1%). The most common preoperative regime was
      amoxicillin 2 g given orally 1 hour before the procedure (21.6%, n = 24)
      following amoxicillin 750 mg given orally 1 day prior to surgery (21.6%, n = 24).
      The most common routine postoperative regime was amoxicillin 750 mg given orally 
      for 7 days (34.0%, n = 66). To treat postoperative infections during the
      osseointegration period, 233 respondents (93.2%) prescribed antibiotics (95%CI
      91.4 to 97.2%). The most common regime used was amoxicillin and potassium
      clavulanate 875/125 mg, given orally for 7 days (51.9%, n = 121). Conclusions:
      There is no consensus among dental clinicians regarding antibiotic use during
      routine dental implant placement to prevent postoperative complications and/or
      early failures. Moreover, the most commonly-prescribed regimes differ from that
      recommend in the latest published studies. Key words:Antibiotics, dental
      implants, oral implantology, complications, postoperative wound infection, early 
      failure.

AB  - Joint replacements have proved a medical success providing symptomatic relief and
      return to mobility in many patients with arthritis. However, multiple revision
      surgeries due to joint failure can result in complex revision scenarios with
      significant bone tissue loss, in an elderly population, which poses a significant
      clinical challenge. Computer-aided design-computer-assisted manufacturing
      (CAD-CAM) prototyped bespoke implants are currently being used as an alternative 
      and innovative approach for joint restoration in salvage cases, while the
      incorporation of autologous skeletal stem cells to optimize regenerative capacity
      can enhance implant osseointegration. We present a case series of 11 patients
      with severe disability and significant bone loss due to failed joint
      replacements. The choice of CAD-CAM prototyped joint implants enhanced with
      autologous skeletal stem cells resulted in significant patient-reported clinical 
      and radiological improvements.

TI  - Prosthetically Driven Computer-Guided Implant Placement and Restoration Using
      CEREC: A Case Report.
PG  - 311-317
AB  - Developments in 3-dimentional (3D) diagnostic technology and advanced digital
      optical imaging have improved the predictability, safety, and efficiency of
      restoratively driven implant dentistry. Surgical procedures may now be performed 
      in a single visit utilizing chairside, computer-aided design/computer-aided
      manufacturing technology and in situations when a two-stage implant protocol is
      indicated as demonstrated in this case. The CEREC(R) GALILEOS(R) integration
      workflow system was used to prosthetically plan and place an implant in the lower
      right mandibular first molar site, No. 30, which had been previously grafted
      following tooth extraction. Preoperative planning was performed, taking into
      consideration all anatomic landmarks, current tissue status, and restorative
      needs while incorporating cone-beam computed tomography data to design and mill a
      stable, tooth-supported surgical guide (CEREC Guide 2.0). After placement and
      subsequent osseointegration, the implant was restored chairside in a pre-doctoral
      treatment center. The Sirona TiBase system and VITA ENAMIC(R) IS block were used 
      to produce an esthetically pleasing and clinically excellent screw-retained
      implant crown.

      in Implant Surgery for Edentulous Patient: a Systematic Review.
PG  - e1
LID - 10.5037/jomr.2018.9101 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: The purpose of the present study is to systematically review the
      accuracy of implant placement with mucosa-supported stereolithographic surgical
      guide and to find out what factors can influence the accuracy. Material and
      Methods: An electronic literature search was performed through the MEDLINE
      (PubMed) and EMBASE databases. The articles are including human studies published
      in English from October 2008 to October, 2017. From the examination of selected
      articles, deviations between virtual planning and actual implant placement were
      analysed regarding the global apical, global coronal, and angulation position.
      Results: A total of 119 articles were reviewed, and 6 of the most relevant
      articles that are suitable to the criteria were selected. The present data
      included 572 implants and 93 patients. The result in the present systematic
      review shows that mean apical global deviation ranges from 0.67 (SD 0.34) mm to
      2.19 (SD 0.83) mm, mean coronal global deviation ranges from 0.6 (SD 0.25) mm to 
      1.68 (SD 0.25) mm and mean angular deviation - from 2.6 degrees (SD 1.61 degrees 
      ) to 4.67 degrees (SD 2.68 degrees ). Conclusions: It's clearly shown from most
      of the examined studies that the mucosa-supported stereolithographic surgical
      guide, showed not exceeding in apically 2.19 mm, in coronally 1.68 mm and in
      angular deviation 4.67 degrees . Surgeons should be aware of the possible linear 
      and angular deviations of the system. Accuracy can be influenced by bone density,
      mucosal thickness, surgical techniques, type of jaw, smoking habits and implant
      length. Further studies should be performed in order to find out which jaw can
      have better accuracy and how the experience can influence the accuracy.

AB  - A high failure rate of titanium implants in diabetic patients has been indicated 
      in clinical evidences. Excessive oxidative stress at the bone-implant interface
      plays an important role in the impaired osteointegration under diabetic
      conditions. While the underlying mechanisms remain unknown and the targeted
      treatments are urgently needed. Ophiopogonin D (OP-D), isolated from Chinese
      herbal Radix Ophiopogon japonicus, is generally reported to be a potent
      antioxidant agent. In the present study, we hypothesized that OP-D exerted
      promotive effects on osteointegration against oxidative stress, and investigated 
      the underlying mechanisms associated with alteration of Wnt/beta-catenin
      signaling pathway. Rabbit osteoblasts incubated on titanium alloy implant were
      co-cultured with normal serum (NS), diabetic serum (DS), DS + OP-D, DS + NAC (a
      potent ROS inhibitor) and DS + OP-D + Dkk1 (a Wnt inhibitor) for examinations of 
      osteoblast behaviors. For in vivo study, titanium alloy implants were implanted
      into the femoral condyle defects on diabetic rabbits. Results demonstrated that
      diabetes-induced oxidative stress resulted in osteoblast dysfunctions and
      apoptotic injury at the bone-implant interface, concomitant with the inactivation
      of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Importantly, OP-D administration attenuated
      oxidative stress, directly reactivating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Osteoblast
      dysfunctions were thus reversed as evidenced by improved osteoblast adhesion,
      proliferation and differentiation, and ameliorated apoptotic injury, exerting
      similar effects to NAC treatment. In addition, the positive effects afforded by
      OP-D were confirmed by improved osteointegration and oetogenesis within the
      titanium alloy implants in vivo by Micro-CT and histological analyses.
      Furthermore, the pro-osteogenic effects of OP-D were almost completely abolished 
      by the Wnt inhibitor Dkk1. These results demonstrated, for the first time, OP-D
      administration alleviated the damaged osteointegration of titanium alloy implants
      under diabetic conditions by means of inhibiting oxidative stress via a
      Wnt/beta-catenin-dependent mechanism. The OP-D administration would become a
      reliable treatment strategy for implant failure therapy in diabetics due to the
      optimal anti-oxidative and pro-osteogenic properties.

      on early osseointegration.

LID - 10.1002/JPER.17-0680 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that medical devices comprising strontium
      contribute to bone healing and osseointegration. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the in vivo performance of surface-functionalized implants (Ti-Sr-O)
      showing predictable release characteristics of strontium and compare it to
      performance a commercially available fluoride-modified surface. METHODS: Ti-Sr-O 
      functionalized, fluoride-modified, Grade 4 titanium implants were inserted in the
      femoral condyle of adult male New Zealand white rabbits. Atomic absorption
      spectrometry (AAS) was utilized to monitor strontium blood serum levels. Two
      weeks after insertion, histomorphometric evaluation was performed with respect to
      bone-to-implant contact (BIC%) and bone formation (BF%) using defined regions of 
      interest. RESULTS: Mean values for BIC% showed a comparable degree of
      osseointegration for Ti-Sr-O and the fluoride-modified surface, while BF%
      revealed a significant difference in increased BF with Ti-Sr-O. AAS measurements 
      did not indicate any influence of the Ti-Sr-O modified implants on the strontium 
      blood serum concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, it
      was shown that the Ti-Sr-O coating, with sustained release characteristics of
      strontium, enhanced bone apposition and, thus, could find practical applications,
      e.g., within the field of medical implantology.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to analyse results achieved with
      the S-ROM modular stem in revision surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      retrospective observational study was conducted from 2007 to 2015 including 51
      patients who had a follow-up of >/= 2 years and complete medical history. The
      mean age was 66.5 years old (34-87). The main reason for revision was aseptic
      loosening (38 cases, 74.5%), followed by infection (10, 19.6%), instability (2,
      3.9%) and an adverse reaction associated with a metal-on-metal hip implant (1,
      2%). Using the Paprosky classification, there were 22 cases of type I (43.1%), 27
      of type II (52.9%) and 2 of type IIIA (4%). At the end of the follow-up,
      radiological parameters were assessed using Engh's criteria. Pre- and
      postoperative clinical status was assessed using the Harris Hip Score, a visual
      analogue scale and the Merle D'Aubigne score. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period 
      was 5.7 years (2-10). The mean Harris Hip Score improved from 45.5 points (22-65)
      to 85.8 (55-100) (p < 0.001), and the final mean Merle D'Aubigne scores were 5.2,
      4.6 and 5.6 for pain, ability to walk and mobility, respectively.
      Osseointegration was confirmed in all except one patient with fibrous non-union. 
      No aseptic loosening has been recorded. Postoperative complications were deep
      infection in four cases (7.8%) and dislocation in three (5.9%). CONCLUSION: This 
      study indicates good medium-term outcomes using a modular hip replacement system 
      with porous-coated proximal sleeves in revision surgery in patients with Paprosky
      type I and II defects.

AB  - Despite technological advancements, further innovations in the field of
      orthopedics and bone regeneration are essential to meet the rising demands of an 
      increasing aging population and associated issues of disease, injury and trauma. 
      Nanotopography provides new opportunities for novel implant surface modifications
      and promises to deliver further improvements in implant performance. However, the
      technical complexities of nanotopography fabrication and surface analysis have
      precluded identification of the optimal surface features to trigger osteogenesis.
      We herein detail the osteoinductive potential of discrete nanodot and nanowire
      nanotopographies. We have examined the ability of modified titanium and titanium 
      alloy (Ti64) surfaces to induce bone-specific gene activation and extracellular
      matrix protein expression in human skeletal stem cells (SSCs) in vitro, and de
      novo osteogenic response within a murine calvarial model in vivo. This study
      provides evidence of enhanced osteogenic response to nanowires 300 surface
      modifications, with important implications for clinical orthopedic application.

TI  - Primary total hip arthroplasty: Staying out of trouble intraoperatively.
PG  - 30-33
LID - 10.1016/j.amsu.2018.03.043 [doi]
AB  - Total hip Arthroplasty is one of the most successful and commonly performed
      procedures in Orthopaedic Surgery. Meticulous preoperative planning allows to
      surgeon anticipate potential problems to reduce postoperative complications and
      optimize patient outcomes. Currently, the posterior approach is the most common
      approach utilized in the United States. In order to prevent errors in stem
      version, especially with cementless fixation, the entry point should be
      posterior, and the initial entry point should be aligned in the correct
      anteversion as this will determine the ultimate version of the stem. Preoperative
      evaluation should asses for true and apparent lengths. For successful
      osseointegration of cementless components, bone ingrowth occurs when there is
      less than 40mum of motion between the implant and bone. Certain socket
      conformations such as elliptical versus hemispherical are more prone to generate 
      fractures at the time of impaction.

AB  - Purpose: Studies have shown that strontium-doped medical applications benefit
      bone metabolism leading to improved bone healing and osseointegration. Based on
      this knowledge, the aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of an
      implant surface, functionalized by a physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating
      (Ti-Sr-O), designed to yield predictable release of strontium. The Ti-Sr-O
      functionalized surface is compared to a routinely used, commercially available
      surface (SLActive) with respect to bone-to-implant contact (BIC%) and new bone
      formation (BF%) in two defined regions of interest (ROI-I and ROI-II,
      respectively). Materials and methods: Ti-Sr-O functionalized, SLActive, and Grade
      4 titanium implants were inserted in the femoral condyle of adult male New
      Zealand White rabbits. The PVD magnetron-sputtered Ti-Sr-O surface coating was
      characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphology and coating
      thickness. Strontium release and mechanical stability of the coating, under
      simulated insertion conditions, were evaluated. Furthermore, histomorphometrical 
      BIC and BF were carried out 2 weeks after insertion. Results: Histomorphometry
      revealed increased bone formation of Ti-Sr-O with significant differences
      compared to SLActive and Grade 4 titanium in both regions of interest, ROI-I and 
      ROI-II, at 0-250 microm and 250-500 microm distance from the implant surfaces.
      Analogous results of bone-to-implant contact were observed for the two modified
      surfaces. Conclusion: The results show that a nanopatterned Ti-Sr-O
      functionalized titanium surface, with sustained release of strontium, increases
      peri-implant bone volume and could potentially contribute to enhancement of bone 
      anchorage of osseointegrated implants.

AB  - Background: Titanium (Ti) implants are extensively used in reconstructive surgery
      and orthopedics. However, the intrinsic inertness of untreated Ti implants
      usually results in insufficient osseointegration. In order to improve the
      osteoconductivity properties of the implants, they are coated with hierarchical
      microtopographic/nanotopographic coatings employing the method of molecular
      layering of atomic layer deposition (ML-ALD). Results: The analysis of the
      fabricated nanostructured relief employing scanning electron microscopy, atomic
      force microscopy, and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis clearly
      demonstrated the formation of the nanotopographic (<100 nm) and microtopographic 
      (0.1-0.5 mum) titano-organic structures on the surface of the nanograined Ti
      implants. Subsequent coincubation of the MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts on the
      microtopographic/nanotopographic surface of the implants resulted in enhanced
      osteogenic cell differentiation (the production of alkaline phosphatase,
      osteopontin, and osteocalcin). In vivo assessment of the osseointegrative
      properties of the microtopographically/nanotopographically coated implants in a
      model of below-knee amputation in New Zealand rabbits demonstrated enhanced new
      bone formation in the zone of the bone-implant contact (as measured by X-ray
      study) and increased osseointegration strength (removal torque measurements).
      Conclusion: The fabrication of the hierarchical microtopographic/nanotopographic 
      coatings on the nanograined Ti implants significantly improves the
      osseointegrative properties of the intraosseous Ti implants. This effect could be
      employed in both translational and clinical studies in orthopedic and
      reconstructive surgery.

TI  - [Clinical evaluation of simple maxillary sinus elevation with simultaneous
      implant in patients with serious posterior maxillary deficiency].
PG  - 633-636
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical effect of simple osteotome sinus floor
      elevation without bone grafting in the posterior maxilla area with less bone
      height. METHODS: Twenty eight cases with posterior maxillary bone deficiency were
      included.Their residual alveolar bone height (RBH) was less than 7 mm. 40 ITI
      implants were implanted. Among them, 6 implants were implanted in the sites with 
      RBH less than 4 mm (group 1), 34 were implanted in the sites with RBH between 4
      to 7 mm (group 2).16 implants were inserted with bone graft, while 24 implants
      were inserted without bone graft. 6-12 months after operation, the alveolar bone 
      height were measured and recorded. SPSS19.0 software package was used for data
      analysis. RESULTS: All 40 implants in 28 patients had good initial stability and 
      good osseointegration, the success rate was 100%. RBH in group 1 and group 2 was 
      (3.44+/-0.57) mm, (5.50+/-1.00) mm, respectively; postoperative bone increase was
      (7.91+/-1.06) mm in group 1, (8.77+/-1.15) mm in group 2, respectively
      (P>0.05).Preoperative RBHin bone graft group was (5.37+/-1.24) mm and
      (5.07+/-1.19) mm in patients without bone graft. Postoperative bone increase was 
      (8.47+/-1.18) mm in bone graft group, and (8.89+/-1.13)mm in patients without
      bone graft, responsively (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Maxillary sinus elevation can be 
      successfully performed in patients with RBH<4 mm, and the effect is similar to
      that of conventional maxillary sinus lifting. Simple osteotome sinus floor
      elevation without bone grafting, which is with less trauma and lower cost, is
      effective in improving bone height in posterior maxillary region.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the osseointegration of a novel coating-plasma-sprayed 
      zirconia in dental implant. Methods: Zirconia coating on non-thread titanium
      implant was prepared using plasma spraying, the implant surface morphology,
      surface roughness and wettability were measured. In vivo, zirconia coated
      implants were inserted in rabbit tibia and animals were respectively sacrificed
      at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after implantation. The bond strength between implant and
      bone was measured by push-out test. The osseointegration was observed by scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM), micro CT and histological analyses. Quantified
      parameters including removal torque, and bone-implant contact (BIC) percentage
      were calculated. Results: The surface roughness (1.6 microm) and wettability
      (54.6 degrees ) of zirconia coated implant was more suitable than those of
      titanium implant (0.6 microm and 74.4 degrees ) for osseointegration. At 12
      weeks, the push-out value of zirconia coated implant and titanium implant were
      (64.9+/-3.0) and (50.4+/-2.9) N, and BIC value of these two groups were
      (54.7+/-3.6)% and (41.5+/-3.6)%. All these differences had statistical
      significance. Conclusions: The surface characters of zirconia coated implant were
      more suitable for osseointegration and present better osseointegration than
      smooth titanium implant in vivo, especially at early stage.

AB  - Objective: To establish the experimental model of rabbit mandibular anterior
      implant repair and evaluate the effects of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta3
      and dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) in promoting the bone integration of implant.
      Methods: The New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into experimental group,
      control group and blank group (6 rabbits for each group) . In the experimental
      group, the implant area was filled with the mixture of TGF-beta3, DPSC and
      Bio-oss powder. In the control group, the implant area was filled with the
      mixture of DPSC and Bio-oss powder. In the blank group, the implant area was
      filled with the mixture of phosphate buffer solution and Bio-oss powder. Eighteen
      New Zealand rabbits were sacrificed in 2 weeks after procedure. The treated
      alveolar bone tissue was observed. The bone tissue around the implant were
      estimated by HE staining, immunocytochemical staining and real-time quantitative 
      PCR. Results: The implants were no shedding nor loose. HE staining shows the
      blank group had a sparse trabecular bone and a small amount of blood vessel
      around the implant and no obvious new bone formation. The control group showed
      that the bone trabecula around the implant was sparse and slender, the
      osteoblasts were arranged linearly around the trabecular bone, a small amount of 
      new bone formation was found around the implant. In the experimental group, there
      were more thick and dense trabecular bone around the implant, the surrounding
      osteoblasts were arranged in clusters. The osteoblasts were active and many new
      bone formed. Typical bone lacunae, bone cells and a large number of new blood
      vessels can be observed. Immunohistochemistry showed that the proportion of
      average positive area in the experimental group, control group, blank group were 
      (24.6+/-5.3) %, (11.3+/-2.8) % and (7.6+/-3.8) % respectively. The expression of 
      bone sialoprotein in experimental group were significantly higher than the other 
      2 groups(P=0.000). Real-time quantitative PCR results showed that the expression 
      level of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), type collagen (COL-),
      alkaline phosphatase in the experimental group was higher than in the blank
      group. The expression level of RUNX2 and COL- in the experimental group was
      higher than that of the control group (P=0.023). Conclusions: TGF-beta3 has
      potential to promote the transformation of DPSC into osteoblasts, which can
      promote the integration of bone around the implant.

TI  - Ten-Year Clinical and Radiological Outcomes of 100 Total Hip Arthroplasty Cases
      with a Modern Cementless Dual Mobility Cup.
PG  - 331-336
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The original cementless Sunfit(R) dual mobility cup (SERF, Decines,
      France) exhibited limited osseointegration due to its hydroxyapatite and alumina 
      coating. We hypothesized that replacement of the alumina with plasma-sprayed
      titanium + hydroxyapatite and improvement of the external geometry (Sunfit TH(R))
      would not increase the risk of aseptic loosening. The primary goal of this study 
      was to determine the survivorship and clinical and radiological outcomes among
      patients with the Sunfit TH(R) implant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a
      single-center, prospective study of the first 100 consecutive total hip
      arthroplasty (THA) cases performed using the combination of a press-fit Sunfit
      TH(R) dual mobility cup and a cementless straight stem. All of the cases were
      primary THA and the posterolateral approach was used. The patients underwent
      regular clinical and radiological monitoring. Radiological measurements were
      carried out using OsiriX(R) software (Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland). RESULTS: As
      of the final follow-up, 19 patients had died and 4 could not be contacted. Of the
      remaining patients, there were zero cases of aseptic loosening, dislocation or
      intraprosthetic dislocation (IPD). The survivorship was 100% at 10.03 years of
      follow-up. No significant implant migration was measured on radiographs.
      CONCLUSION: The excellent long-term outcomes with the Sunfit TH(R) cup are likely
      due to the use of plasma-sprayed titanium + hydroxyapatite in the coating and the
      addition of supplementary ridges and grooves to the outside of the cup. The
      absence of aseptic loosening, dislocation and IPD further confirms the high
      stability and good survivorship that can be achieved with these implants. We
      believe dual mobility cups should be used in patients above 60 years of age and
      in those below 60 years of age with a high risk of postoperative instability.

TI  - Pro-osteogenic properties of hydrophilic and hydrophobic titanium surfaces:
      Crosstalk between signalling pathways in in vivo models.
PG  - 598-609
LID - 10.1111/jre.12550 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is now generally accepted that the response to a particular
      signal, such as the surgical trauma following implant placement, is not the
      result of a single linear signalling pathway, but rather reflects pathway
      integration, which can occur at multiple levels. Although it is well documented
      that both SLA and SLActive surfaces are able to promote bone formation and
      osseointegration, it is still unclear which are the key signalling pathways
      involved and how surface hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity might affect pathway
      integration. OBJECTIVE: To combine gene and protein data from in vivo studies
      applying titanium hydrophobic (Sandblasting, Large-grit, Acid-etching, SLA) and
      hydrophilic (SLActive) surfaces to understand the molecular mechanisms
      responsible for the pro-osteogenic properties of these surfaces. METHODS: The
      Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG((R)) ) pathway database and the
      Ingenuity((R)) Pathway Analysis (IPA((R)) ) software were applied to the genomic 
      and proteomic data of previous in vivo studies applying SLA and SLActive
      surfaces, with the specific aim to focus on bone formation-related signalling
      pathways. While gene data were derived from a human study on osseointegration,
      protein data originated from a preclinical study in rabbits. Data were available 
      for the 4, 7 and 14 days of healing periods. RESULTS: Both genomic and proteomic 
      data showed that the osteogenesis process takes place mainly at 7 and 14 days of 
      healing on both SLA and SLActive surfaces. Surface hydrophilicity enhances bone
      formation at multiple levels, by directly promoting an earlier expression of
      pathways involved in cell proliferation and osteoblast precursor differentiation 
      (eg, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide-3 kinase-AKT, Wnt, Notch,
      transforming growth factor-beta), but also by positively regulating angiogenesis,
      bone mineralization and bone remodelling. CONCLUSION: This study combined, for
      the first time, different 'omics' outputs to get new insights on the molecular
      mechanisms behind the influence of surface hydrophilicity on
      osseointegration/bone formation. Specific signalling pathways, such as Wnt,
      vascular endothelial growth factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase, were
      identified as differentially modulated by titanium surface hydrophilicity both at
      a genomic and proteomic level. These findings may be used in the future to
      monitor/predict the bone formation/osseointegration process, or as a screening
      tool towards the manufacture of new pro-osteogenic implant surfaces. In order to 
      take into account the full complexity and interplay of cell signalling during
      bone formation, powerful bioinformatics tools integrating different 'omics' data 
      and predicting signalling pathways trends should be applied by future studies.

TI  - Tritanium Acetabular Cup in Revision Hip Replacement: A Six to Ten Years of
      Follow-Up Study.

LID - 10.1016/j.arth.2018.03.040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of highly porous acetabular components has shown to produce
      good results in revision acetabular surgery. Their surface characteristics
      enhance initial fixation and bone ingrowth which are prerequisites for adequate
      osseointegration. The purpose of this study is to analyze the mid-term to
      long-term survival, clinical and radiological outcomes using the Tritanium cup
      (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ) in revision hip surgery. METHODS: This is a retrospective
      review of all patients who underwent acetabular revision surgery using "Tritanium
      revision cup" between April 2007 and November 2010 at our institution. Sixty-two 
      patients were included with a mean age of 67.5 years (32-86). According to
      Paprosky classification, 10 patients had type I defect, 8 had type IIA, 27 had
      type IIB, 7 had type IIC, and 10 suffered from type IIIA defect. A Kaplan-Meier
      analysis was used to determine the survival of the cup. Functional outcomes were 
      assessed using Oxford Hip Score. Plain radiographs were performed to assess
      implant fixation and osseointegration. RESULTS: The acetabular cup aseptic
      survivorship was 98.4% at a mean follow-up of 87.6 months. The mean Oxford Hip
      Score improved from 14.5 (3-31) preoperatively to 38.5 (12-48) at the final
      follow-up. Two cups were revised (3.2%): 1 for aseptic loosening and 1 for
      infection. CONCLUSION: Tritanium revision acetabular cup has shown excellent
      mid-term to long-term clinical and radiographic results with low failure rate and
      minimal complications. Longer term follow-up would be of value to assess the
      ongoing survival of this implant construct.

      Submitted to Immediate Loading: A Prospective Clinical Study.
PG  - 282-287
LID - 10.1097/ID.0000000000000764 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Characteristics of the implant surface may benefit osseointegration, 
      and the knowledge of this process in diverse clinical situations may play a role 
      in implant dentistry practice. PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to
      compare the stability of dental implants with different types of surface
      treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five implants were placed in the
      mandibles of 11 fully edentulous patients. Group 1 (G1) consisted of 27 implants 
      with a hydrophilic surface. Group 2 (G2) consisted of 28 implants (double
      sandblasting and acid etching). Implants were distributed randomly; equal
      surfaces were not placed contiguously. Measurements were taken after surgery
      (baseline) and 10, 30, 60, and 90 days, 4 and 8 months after surgery. Resonance
      frequency analysis (RFA) was used for determining the stability. RESULTS: No
      statistically significant differences were found. The largest difference in
      implant stability quotient (ISQ) between groups occurred at the first evaluation 
      (ISQ approximately 69.8 in G1 and approximately 68.4 in G2). Reductions in
      stability were more accentuated in the first month, returning to values similar
      to baseline in the subsequent months, with peak stability reached at 8 months
      (ISQ approximately 69.8 in G1 and approximately 69.8 in G2). CONCLUSION: No
      statistically significant differences were found in the stability of the implants
      placed in edentulous mandibular arch, submitted to immediate loading analyzed
      using RFA.

      osteoblasts.
PG  - 187-195
LID - 10.1302/2046-3758.72.BJR-2017-0228.R1 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Enhanced micromotions between the implant and surrounding bone can
      impair osseointegration, resulting in fibrous encapsulation and aseptic loosening
      of the implant. Since the effect of micromotions on human bone cells is sparsely 
      investigated, an in vitro system, which allows application of micromotions on
      bone cells and subsequent investigation of bone cell activity, was developed.
      Methods: Micromotions ranging from 25 microm to 100 microm were applied as sine
      or triangle signal with 1 Hz frequency to human osteoblasts seeded on collagen
      scaffolds. Micromotions were applied for six hours per day over three days.
      During the micromotions, a static pressure of 527 Pa was exerted on the cells by 
      Ti6Al4V cylinders. Osteoblasts loaded with Ti6Al4V cylinders and unloaded
      osteoblasts without micromotions served as controls. Subsequently, cell
      viability, expression of the osteogenic markers collagen type I, alkaline
      phosphatase, and osteocalcin, as well as gene expression of osteoprotegerin,
      receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand, matrix metalloproteinase-1, and tissue
      inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, were investigated. Results: Live and dead cell 
      numbers were higher after 25 microm sine and 50 microm triangle micromotions
      compared with loaded controls. Collagen type I synthesis was downregulated in
      respective samples. The metabolic activity and osteocalcin expression level were 
      higher in samples treated with 25 microm micromotions compared with the loaded
      controls. Furthermore, static loading and micromotions decreased the
      osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand ratio. Conclusion: Our
      system enables investigation of the behaviour of bone cells at the bone-implant
      interface under shear stress induced by micromotions. We could demonstrate that
      micromotions applied under static pressure conditions have a significant impact
      on the activity of osteoblasts seeded on collagen scaffolds. In future studies,
      higher mechanical stress will be applied and different implant surface structures
      will be considered.Cite this article: J. Ziebart, S. Fan, C. Schulze, P. W.

AB  - Osteoblast cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is established through two
      main pathways: one is mediated by the binding between integrin and a minimal
      adhesion sequence (RGD) on the extracellular protein, the other is based on the
      interactions between transmembrane proteoglycans and heparin-binding sequences
      found in many matrix proteins. The aim of this study is the evaluation in an in
      vivo endosseous implant model of the early osteogenic response of the
      peri-implant bone to a biomimetic titanium surface functionalized with the
      retro-inverso 2DHVP peptide, an analogue of Vitronectin heparin binding site. The
      experimental plan is based on a bilateral study design of Control and 2DHVP
      implants inserted respectively in the right and left femur distal metaphysis of
      adult male Wistar rats (n=16) weighing about 300grams and evaluated after 15days.
      Fluorochromic bone vital markers were given in a specific time frame, in order to
      monitor the dynamic of new bone deposition. The effect inducted by the
      peptidomimetic coating on the surrounding bone were qualitatively and
      quantitatively evaluated by means of static and dynamic histomorphometric
      analyses performed within three concentric and subsequent circular Regions of
      Interest (ROI) of equivalent thickness (220mum), ROI1 adjacent to the interface, 
      ROI2, the middle, and ROI3 the farthest. The data indicated that these
      functionalized implants stimulated a higher bone apposition rate (p<0,01) and
      larger and rapid osteoblast activation in terms of mineralizing surface within
      ROI1 compared to the control (p<0,01). These higher osteoblast recruitment and
      activation leads to a greater bone-to-implant contact reached for DHVP samples
      (p<0,5). This represents an initial stimulus of the osteogenic activity that
      might results in a faster and better osteointegration process.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recently, significant progress has been made in the research
      related to regenerative medicine. At the same time, biomedical implants in
      orthopedics and dentistry are facing many challenges and posing clinical
      concerns. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the clinical
      applications of current regenerative strategies to the fields of dentistry and
      orthopedic surgery. The main research question in this review is: What are the
      major advancement strategies in regenerative medicine that can be used for
      implant research? RECENT FINDINGS: The implant surfaces can be modified through
      patient-specific stem cells and plasma coatings, which may provide methods to
      improve osseointegration and sustainability of the implant. Overall understanding
      from the review suggesting that the outcome from the studies could lead to
      identify optimum solutions for many concerns in biomedical implants and even in
      drug developments as a long-term solution to orthopedic and dental patients.

TI  - Chronological Age as Factor Influencing the Dental Implant Osseointegration in
      the Jaw Bone.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate osseointegration of dental implant 
      in the jaw bone in the young and elderly population and comparing the results to 
      assess indicators and risk factors as age for the success or failure of dental
      implants. A retrospective study of 107 implants (Impladent, LASAK, Czech
      Republic) was prepared. The patients at implants surgery were divided in three
      groups. The patients were followed-up for a 7-year period. We evaluated
      osseointegration from long term point of view as a change of marginal bone levels
      close to dental implant. Marginal bone levels were recorded and analysed with
      regard to different patient- and implant-related factors. An influence of
      chronological age on change of marginal bone levels during 6-year retrospective
      study vas evaluated. The study examined 47 patient charts and 107 implants from
      the Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol.
      We proved that young healthy patients with long bridges or Branemarks have the
      same progression of marginal bone levels changes. The chronological age hasn't
      therefore direct influence on the osseointegration from long term point of view. 
      But we found that the length of dental suprastrucure-prosthetic construction
      negatively influences marginal bone changes, though these results weren't
      statistically significant. More extensive dental implant suprastrucure undergoes 
      smaller osseointegration. On the other hand the length of dental suprastrucure
      (prosthetic construction) negatively influences dental osseointegration in both
      groups of patient.
